In the case of a person assaulted by many accused, the criminal act is the offence which finally results, though the achievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons.(ii)Knowledge in s. 304 Part 11 is the knowledge of likelihood of death and the common intention is with regard to the criminal act. If the result of the criminal act is the death of the victim and if each of the assailants possesses the knowledge that death is the likely consequence of the criminal act, there is no reason why s. 34 should not be read with the second part of s. 304 to make each liable individually.lbra Akanda v.

N. Mukherjee, for the appellants.P. K. Chakravarti and P. K. Bose, for the respondent.173 January 7, 1964.The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH J.-The six appellants who have appealed to this Court by special leave were convicted by the Assistant Sessions Judge, Birbhum under s. 304 Part II read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to six years' rigorous imprisonment each. Their appeal to the High Court was summarily dismissed. When the appellants applied for a certificate in the High Court they made it plain that the only point which was required to be considered by this Court was whether s. 34 could be read in conjunction with Part 11 of s. 304, Indian Penal Code. In this Court the argument was confined to this point of law. The High Court rejected the application for the certificate pointing out that the controversy had been settled by a Full Bench decision of the High Court reported in Ibra Akanda v. Emperor(1). The learned Judges were of the opinion that the point was not of sufficient importance for permitting the appellants to take an appeal to this Court.For the consideration of the point of law which has been debated before us, we may state only such facts as will bring out the controversy. One Abdul Sheikh in the company of his son, Adut, aged 13, went to his field in village Noapara to uproot linseed plants. This was on the morning of March 13, 1962. While he was, so employed, two of the appellants, Afrahim and Jesed, appeared on the scene, and Afrahim asked Jesed to catch hold of Abdul Sheikh. Abdul Sheikh took to his heels and was chased by these two appel- lants, who overtook him and threw him down on the ground Immediately thereafter, there appeared on the scene the re- maining appellants. Jarahim was armed with a ballam and he started to hit Abdul Sheikh on his legs with the ballam.The appellant, Manu, arrived with a sabal (crowbar), and began to strike Abdul Sheikh and the appellant, Mesher.began to strike Abdul Sheikh with a lathi. All this, while, the sixth appellant, Makid, held Abdul Sheikh by the legs and Afrahim and Jesed held him down by his head and shoulders. The incident was witnessed by Adut and two, others, and it is on the testimony of Adut and these two (1) I.L.R.(1944) 2 Cal. 405.174 other witnesses, to whom reference is unnecessary, that the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Birbhum, came to the con- clusion that the offence was committed in the manner described above. Abdul Sheikh was seriously injured; both his legs below the knee were fractured and one arm above the wrist was also fractured. He had also some incised wounds and some bruises. He was examined by one Dr. Bashiruddin, who gave him first aid. Dr. Bashiruddin stated on oath that Abdul Sheikh narrated to him the incident and named all the six appellants. Later, Abdul Sheikh was removed to Nalhati Health Centre, and while arrangements were being made for recording his dying declaration, he succumbed to his injuries. He had, however, made dying declarations to some of the prosecution witnesses and they have deposed to the fact that he had named the six appellants as his assailants.In this appeal, we did not allow Dr. D. N. Mukherjee, counsel for the appellants, to argue on facts. We assumed that the incident took place as narrated by the witnesses.Mr. Mukherjee contends that the conviction of the appellants under s. 304, Part 11 is illegal, because according to him, s. 34 cannot be called in aid, as the second part of s. 304 concerns itself with knowledge and absolutely excludes intention as the ingredient of the offence. He relies upon the minority decision of Das J. (as he then was) in Ibra A kanda v. Emperor(1). In that case, the learned Judge had expressed the opinion that s. 34 was incapable of being read with the second Part of s. 304. With the view of the learn- ed Judge, Lodge J. differed and the case was then placed before Khundkar J. who agreed with Lodge J., and the deci- sion was that s. 34 could be so read. At the hearing Mr.Mukherjee drew our attention to three other cases in which a view supporting his contention appears to have been taken.The first is a single Judge decision of the Allahabad High Court reported in Ramnath v. Emperor(2), and the other is a Division Bench case from Peshawar reported in Sahibzada v.The Crown(3). He also referred to an earlier Calcutta case reported in Debi Charan Haldar v. Emperor(1), in which a division Bench had expressed some (1) 1. L. R. (1944) 2 Cal. 405.(3) A.I.R. 1950 Peshawar 24.(2) A.I.R. 1943 All. 271.(4) 41 C.W.N. 570.175 doubts about the applicability of s. 34 to s. 304, Part 1.As against this, Mr. Chakravarti, counsel for the State relied upon a Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court reported in Saidu Khan v. State(1) where it has been clearly held that s. 34 can be so read.Before dealing with the point of law, we shall refer to the essential facts once again. Apart from the fact that there is proof that there were two parties and there was enmity between the appellants and Abdul Sheikh, the facts proved in the case clearly establish that Abdul Sheikh had gone for a peaceful purpose in the company of his young son, and immediately after his arrival, he was chased by two of the appellants and caught and felled to the ground. After this the remaining four appellants appeared and beat Abdul Sheikh with diverse weapons, while those who were not armed, held him pinned to the ground. Mr. Chakravarti is right in contending on these facts that the act took place in furtherance of a common intention. No doubt, as has been laid down by the Privy Council and by this Court in cases which are now very familiar, common intention must exist before the criminal act is perpetrated, and that is the essence of s. 34. Here, in our opinion, that requirement was completely satisfied, because the six accused could not but by a prior concert have appeared simultaneously at the scene, and chased and overthrown the victim, held him down and beaten him. The facts disclosed in the evidence clearly establish a prior concert amongst the six appellants. It has been so inhered by the Assistant Sessions Judge, and we see no reason to differ from him.Now that the criminal act has been held by us to have been the result of a previous concert and in furtherance of the common intention, we shall proceed to examine whether s. 34 I.P.C. can be made applicable for the purpose of holding that culpable homicide not amounting to murder was committed, and that each of the appellant was responsible for the offence. Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code reads as follows:\"When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each (1) I.L.R. [1952] 1 AlL. 639.176 of such persons is liable for that act in the same-, manner as if it were done by him alone.\" In s. 33 which precedes, it is laid down that the word \"act\"' denotes not only a single act but also a series of acts. In other words, as was stated by the Judicial Committee, in Barendra Kumar Ghosh's case(1) \"a criminal act means. that unity of criminal behaviour, which results in something, for which an individual would be punishable, if it were all done by himself alone, i.e., a criminal offence.\" Here, the beating was perpetrated not by a single individual but by three persons with whom others were acting in concert. The criminal act resulted in the criminal offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. There is no dispute as to that. Whether all the appellants individually would be responsible for the death of Abdul Sheikh is the question to be determined, and that conclusion can only be reached if it can be said that the act which was committed was done in furtherance of a common intention. It is argued that s. 304 makes a difference in its two parts between the commission of the offence of culpable homicide with a particular intention and the commission of the same offence without that intention but with a particular knowledge. It is urged' that this distinction makes it impossible that s. 34 which deals only with common intention can be read with it. Section 304 reads as follows:- \"Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and' shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause` death, but:(1) [1925] I.L.R. 52 Cal. 197.177 without any intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.\" Sec. 304 does not define culpable homicide not amounting to murder. That definition is to be found in s. 299, which provides:\"Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with *,he intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.\" Culpable homicide is the causing of the death of a person in three ways: (1) with the intention of causing death, (2) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and (3) with the knowledge that the offender is likely by such act to cause death. The offence of culpable homicide becomes murder when four circumstances exist. They are mentioned in s. 300. A number of excep- tions are however included, and those exceptions show extenuating circumstances on strict proof of which the offence is again brought down to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The causing of the death of a person by doing an act accompanied by intention in the two ways described in s. 299 or with the knowledge that the act is likely to cause death also described there is thus distinguished from cases of deaths resulting from accident or rash and negligent act and those cases where death may result but the offence is of causing hurt either simple or grievous. Once it was established, as was established in this case, that the act was a deliberate act and was not the result of accident or rashness or negligence, it is obvious that the offence which was committed was one under s. 304.In the present case however death was not the result of the act of a single individual but was the result of the act of several persons, and they shared the common intention, namely, the commission of the act or acts by which death was occasioned.Section 34 is a part of a group of sections, of which some other sections may also be seen. Section 35 is as follows:134-159 S.C.-12.178 \"Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge or intention.\" In this section also the responsibility is shared by each offender individually if the act which is criminal only by reason of certain criminal knowledge or intention is done by each person sharing that knowledge or intention. Indeed, this section also was applicable here. Under s. 37, \"when an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co-operates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence.\" By co- operating in the doing of several acts which together constitute a single criminal act, each person who co- operates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of the acts is either singly or jointly liable for that offence. Section 38 then provides:\"Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.\" That is to say, even though several persons may do a single criminal act, the responsibility may vary according to the degree of their participation. The illustration which is given clearly brings out that point.Viewing these sections in this manner it is obvious that two sections in this group deal with individual responsibility for a single criminal act perpetrated by a large number of persons who either share a common intention or possess the criminal knowledge (ss. 34 and 35) and the third with co- operation between several accused in the completion of the criminal act (s. 37). Lastly s. 38 provides that the responsibility for the completed criminal act may be of different grades according to the share taken by the different accused in the completion of the criminal act, and this section does not mention anything about intention common or otherwise or knowledge.179 Section 34, when it speaks of a criminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common, intention of all, has regard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of the series of acts which result in the offence. In the case of a person assaulted by many accused, the criminal act is the offence which finally -results, though the achievement of that criminal act may be -the result of action of several persons. No doubt, a person is only responsible ordinarily for what he does and s. 38 -ensures that; but the law in s.34 (and also s. 35) says that if the criminal act is the result of a common intention, then ,every person who did the criminal act with the common intention would be responsible for the total offence irrespective of the share which he had in its perpetration. In. Barendra Kumar Ghosh's case(1), the Judicial Committee ,observed:\"Sec. 34 I.P.C. deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or diverse, by several persons; if all are done in furtherance of a common intention, each person is liable for the result of them all as if he had done them himself. 'That act' and then again 'it' in the latter part of the section must in clude the whole of the action covered by the criminal act in the first part of the section.\" Provided there is common intention, the whole of the -result perpetrated by several offenders, is attributable to each ,offender, notwithstanding that individually they may have done separate acts, diverse or similar. Applying this test to the present case, if all the appellants shared the common intention of severely beating Abdul Sheikh and some held him down and others beat him with their weapons, provided the common intention is accepted, they would all of them be responsible for the whole of the criminal act, that is to Say, the criminal offence of culpable homicide not amounting -,to murder which was committed, irrespective of the part played by them. The common intention which is required by the section is not the intention which s. 299 mentions in its first part. That intention is individual to the offender unless it is shared with others by a prior concert in which ,case ss. 34 or 35 again come into play. Here, the common (1) [1925] I.L.R. 52 Cal. 197 180 intention was to beat Abdul Sheikh, and that common intention was, as we have held above, shared by all of them.That they did diverse acts would ordinarily make their responsibility individual for their own acts, but because of the common intention, they would be responsible for the total effect that they produced if any of the three conditions in s. 299, I.P.C. applied to their case. If it were a case of the first two conditions, the matter is simple. They speak of intention and s. 34 also speaks of intention.The question is whether the second part of s. 304 can be made applicable. The second part no doubt speaks of knowledge and does not refer to intention which has been segregated in the first part. But knowledge is the knowledge of the likelihood of death. Can it be said that when three or four persons start beating a man with heavy lathes, each. hitting his blow with the common intention of severely beating him and each possessing the knowledge that death was the likely result of the beating, the requirements of s. 304, Part II are not satisfied in the case of each of them?'If it could be said that knowledge of this type was possible in the case of each one of the appellants, there is no reason why s. 304, Part II cannot be read with s. 34. The common intention is with regard to the criminal act, i.e., the act of beating. If the result of the beating is the death of the victim, and if each of the assailants possesses the knowledge that death is the likely consequence of the criminal act, i.e.,. beating, there is no reason why s. 34 or s. 35 should not be read with the second part of s.304 to make each liable individually.This matter has been elaborately considered in the judgment of Lodge J. and again in the Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court. We do not think that we need say more on this, because we are in agreement with the decision given by the majority in the Calcutta High Court case and the Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High, Court. It appears to us that in other cases doubt was felt because s. 304 is in two parts, and first part is concerned with culpable homicide committed with two types of intention and the second part with culpable homicide committed with a particular knowledge. It appears that it was felt that s.34, which deals with common intention, could not be read with 181 the second part of s. 304. In our opinion, the learned Judges who held that view and we say it respectfully fell into the error of viewing the second part of s. 3,04 divorced from common intention whatever. A person does not do an act except with a certain intention, and the common intention which is requisite for the application of s. 34 is the common intention of perpetrating a particular act.Previous concert which is insisted upon is the meeting of the minds regarding the achievement of a criminal act. That circumstance is completely fulfilled in a case like the present where a large number of persons attack an individual, chase him, throw him on the ground and beat him till he dies. Even if the ,offence does not come to the grade of murder, and is only culpable homicide not amounting to murder, there is no doubt whatever that the offence is shared by all of them, and s. 34 then makes the responsibility several if there was a knowledge possessed by each of them that death was likely -to be caused as a result of that beating. This circumstance is completely fulfilled in the present case, and we are, therefore, satisfied that the conviction of the appellants was proper, and see no reason to interfere.In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed.Appeal dismissed.LIIofIndia: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback\n",

No. 119-D of 1963.S.T. Desai, J. B. Dadachanji, O. C. Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for the appellant.H.N. Sanyal, Solicitor-General of India and B. P.Maheshwari, for the respondent.183 January 9, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the order of the High Court, Punjab, dated August 14, 1963, by which an order of the Rent Controller under s. 15(1) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, directing the appellant to deposit back rents at Rs. 300 per month from 1st July, 1957, was confirmed. The High Court granted the appellant one month's time from the date of its own order, as the original time had already run out.The appellant is an advocate, who is practising at Delhi.He is occupying No. 43, Prithvi Raj Road, New Delhi as a tenant, and his landlord Seth Kirori Mal Luhariwala is the respondent in this appeal. The tenancy commenced on July 28, 1957, and the memorandum of tenancy, dated July 1, 1957, produced in the case, shows that the premises were taken on a monthly tent of Rs. 300. The memorandum also contains other terms which need not be mentioned here, because they are not relevant to the present appeal. It appears that Seth Kirori Mal was in arrears in payment of his income-tax, and a sum of Rs. 39,00,000 was outstanding from him. On October 31, 1957, the Income-tax Officer Central Circle, New Delhi, to whom all cases of Seth Kirori Mal were transferred, issued a notice to the appellant under s.46(5A) of the Indian Income-fax Act directing him to deposit with the Income-tax Officer all sums due by way of rent as also future rents. The appellant sent no reply to this notice. He had, however,on September 29, 1957, addressed a letter to the respondent Seth Kirori Mal. The reply of Kirori Mal, dated October 15, 1957, figured in the arguments a great deal, and as it is brief, it may be quoted here:\"From TO Dated Faigarh, the 15th October, 1957, 184 Dear Sir, With reference to letter No. M-17-58, dated 29th September, 1957, 1 am to write that you may please adjust six months rent of 43, Prithviraj Road, New Delhi, i.e., Rs. 1800 (rent from 1-10-57 to 31-3-1958) towards your professional fee in part payment thereof. The balance of your fee will be paid later at the time of final settlement.Yours faithfully, (Sd.) Paluram Dhanania, For Kirorimal Luhariwala.Kirori Mal also sent a receipt, dated October 16, 1957, or the amount, and is item 23 in the record.Kirori Mal had litigation in Calcutta. He had brought a suit against four defendants, claiming the present property as his \"absolute\" and \"exclusive self-acquired property\".The case was pending in the High Court and on May 1, 1.958, an order was made appointing one Chakravarti as a Receiver of the properties including No. 43, Prithvi Raj Road.Chakravarti also sent a notice on July 8, 1958, to the appellant demanding rent already due and also as and when due. To this notice, the appellant sent a reply on July 19, 1958. He referred to the payment of rent by adjustment towards fees for the period 1st October, 1957 to 31st March, 1958, which was the subject of the letter above. He stated that as regards rent after 1st April, 1958, he had no objection to pay the amount to the Receiver or any other claimant but regretted that it was not possible for him to make the payment because of the notice served upon him by the Income-tax Officer. He asked the Receiver to get the notice withdrawn, and stated that he would be glad to remit the amount of rent to him when that was done. He also raised the question of certain other expenses which he had incurred in connection with the house which he claimed he was entitled to deduct from the rent and informed that a few repairs were, required in the house. A second letter was sent by the Official Receiver on September 5. 1959, making another demand. In his reply, dated September 14, 1959, to this letter, the appellant raised the 185 -question that a sum of Rs. 23,500 was payable to him for _professional services rendered by him to Seth Kirori Mal.-He stated:\"You will therefore appreciate that I am entitled to adjust the rent payable against the fees due to me and the amount due to me will absorb the rent for a little over six years.Even before this Seth Kirori Mal had paid me a sum of Rs. 1800 by way of adjustment of rent towards my professional fees due. You will, therefore, kindly agree that the rent payable is adjustable against the professional fee due to me.\" With this letter, he enclosed a copy of a statement of fees -amounting to Rs. 23,500 which he had submitted to his ,client on February 4, 1959. The Official Receiver then in- formed the appellant that the party concerned had denied the claim for fees as absolutely false, and observed in his letter that the professional fees should be the subject of -some other proceeding but the rent should be paid with,out delay. He enquired if the amount of rent had been paid 'to the Income-tax department in response to the notice. In his reply to this letter, on July 5, 1960, the appellant for the first time stated that there was an agreement between him and Seth Kirori Mal to adjust the rent towards his professional fees until the fees were fully paid. He offered -to reduce the fees if Seth Kirori Mal had any objection, but stated that till the professional fees were recouped, no rent could be considered to be due from him.On November 25, 1960, Seth Kirori Mal applied to the High Court at Calcutta for directions to the Official Receiver to take appropriate proceedings to realise the arrears of rent from the appellant, and on December 19, 1960, the High Court appointed Seth Kirori Mal receiver in the case. Seth Kirori Mal then served a notice on December 23, 1960, on the appellant to pay the arrears of rent. To this notice, the appellant sent a detailed reply which, in substance, has been his defence in the proceedings before the Rent Controller, from which the present appeal has arisen.186 On January 4, 1961, Seth Kirori Mal made an application under s. 14 of the Delhi Rent Control Act before the Rent Controller, Delhi. In his written statement in reply to that application, the appellant pleaded that Seth Kirori Mal had no right to recover rent from him, inasmuch as a. notice under s. 46(5A) of the Indian Income-tax Act had. been issued by the Income-tax Officer, Central Circle V, New Delhi. He pleaded that the property was in the custody of the Court, and that inasmuch as a receiver had been appointed, Kirori Mal had no locus stands to maintain the petition denying at the same time that Kirori Mal had informed him that he had been appointed a receiver of the property. The appellant also contended that under the Rent Control Act, a receiver had no right to act on behalf of the landlord. He referred to the alleged agreement by which fees were, to be recouped from rent as and when it fell due, pointing out that on an earlier occasion a sum of Rs. 1800 was allowed to be adjusted towards fees. Some other please were raised, but it is not necessary to refer to them because they were not raised before us.The notice to quit which the appellant alleged was not issued to him was filed in the Court of the Controller on May 17, 1961. The appellant was ordered to inspect it and to be ready for his statement as to the correctness of the notice. On the next date, a statement of the appellant was recorded and he denied the notice and also its receipt. The case was then set down for arguments and after hearing the arguments, the Rent Controller passed his order on July 22, 1961. The Rent Controller held that there was no proof on the file to show that the respondent had any right to make an adjustment of the rent against his professional dues. He held that the rent was not paid after March 31. 1958. With regard to the plea that a notice under s. 46(5A) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, had been issued. the Rent Controller observed that the amount, if deposited in his court, would not be paid to Kirori Mal unless he produced a clearance certificate from the Income-tax Department. The Rent Controller also said that if in the enquiry to be subsequently made, the tenant proved that the amount of fees had to be recouped from rent. the amount would not be paid to Kirori Mal.187 Against the decision of the Rent Controller, the appellant filed an appeal before the Rent Control Tribunal. The Rent Control Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Controller, observing that the plea taken by him that his professional fees were to come out of rent was an after-thought and there was no evidence to prove that there was such an agreement between the parties. On other matters, the Tribunal expressed its agreement with the Rent Controller. The appellant then appealed to the High Court of Punjab. The High Court upheld the orders so far made and pointed out that in the letter dated July 19, 1958, to the Receiver, the appellant had not mentioned the agreement. The High Court hi-,Id that the order made under s. 15(1) of the Act was proper, because it was an admitted fact that rent had not been paid to anybody from April 1, 1958. The High Court endorsed the view of the Tribunals below that the notice of the Income-tax Officer did not come in the way of making the deposit of the rent in the office of the Rent Controller, because the amount was not to be paid to anyone till the Rent Controller had decided who was entitled to receive it.The appeal was therefore dismissed.In this court, emphasis is laid upon the letter of October 15, 1957, by Kirori Mal in which there was an adjustment of Rs. 1800 towards fees. It was contended that there was an oral agreement to use the rent to pay the professional fees.The letter itself does not show that there was any such agreement. In fact it shows the contrary where it says:\"The balance of your fees will be paid later at the time of final settlement.\" This shows that the appellant was not entitled to retain the rent in his hands, and the Tribunals below were justified in saying that the plea about the so-called agreement was an after-thought, because till September 14, 1959, the appel- lant had not mentioned such an agreement. We are also satisfied that the plea was a mere device to retain the money and to avoid paying the rent. It must be remembered that there were as many as four claimants, viz., the Income- tax Officer, the Receiver and Kirori Mal in person and Kirori 188 Mal as Receiver, but the appellant avoided each of these in turn by pointing to the others, and in this way continued to occupy the premises without payment of any rent.It was contended however as a matter of law that a proper opportunity ought to have been given to the appellant to prove his plea by leading evidence before ordering that the rent be deposited. Mr. S. T. Desai contended that under s.15(1) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, an order for deposit of arrears of rent can only be made after the tenant has been given an opportunity of being heard, because if the tenant makes a payment or deposit as required of him, the landlord is entitled to take the amount of the deposit and the Controller can award such costs as he may deem fit to the landlord and the case comes to an end. By way of contrast, he pointed out that the case proceeds if the tenant fails to make the payment or deposit as required of him. In other words, it was contended that an order under s. 15(1) for deposit of rent should only be made at the end of the case and not at an interlocutory stage. Mr. Desai contended that the present order was made at an interlocutory stage and it was wrong, because if the tenant deposited the money, there would be no further hearing and his plea that there was an agreement between the parties that the rent as and when it fell due should be set off against the professional fees, would remain untried. In our opinion, this reading is not permissible. Section 15 (omitting such parts as are unnecessary for the present purpose) reads as follows:Section 15.(1) In every proceeding for the recovery of possession of any premises on the ground specified in clause (a) of the proviso to subsection (1) of section 14, the Controller shall, after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard, the an order directing the tenant to pay to the landlord or deposit with the Controller within one month of the date of the order, an amount calculated at the rate of rent at which it was last paid for the period for which the arrears of the rent were legally recoverable from the ten- 189 ant including the period subsequent thereto up to the end of the month previous to that in which payment or deposit is made and to conti- nue to pay or deposit month by month, by the fifteenth of each succeeding month, a sum equivalent to the rent at that rate.(3) If, in any proceeding referred to in subsection (1) or sub-section 2), there is any dispute as to the amount of rent payable by the tenant, the Controller shall, within fifteen days of the date of the first hearing of the proceeding, fix an interim rent in relation to the premises to be paid or deposited in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1) or subsection (2), as the case may be, until the standard rent in relation thereto is fixed having regard to the provisions of this Act, and the amount of arrears, if any, calculated on the basis of the standard rent shall be paid or deposited by the tenant within next month of the date on which the standard rent is fixed or such further time as the Controller may allow in this behalf.(6) If a tenant makes payment or deposit as required by sub-section (1) or sub-section (3), no order shall be made for the recovery of possession on the ground of default in the payment of rent by the tenant but the Controller may allow such costs as he may deem fit to the. landlord.(7) If a tenant -fails to make payment or deposit as required by this section the Controller may order the defence against eviction to be struck out and proceed with the hearing of the application.\" It will be noticed that sub-section (3) also contemplates 190 payment of interim rent determined by the Controller before the entire dispute is settled. Sub-section (6) puts the case under sub-s. (1) and sub-s. (3) on the same footing and makes no distinction between them. It is also possible to visualise cases in which the tenant may deposit the amount of rent under protest and claim that his defence be tried.It is not that even on the deposit of the arrears of rent in these circumstances the case would come to an end. The latter part of sub-section (1) further shows that not only the arrears have to be deposited but rent as it falls due has to be deposited month by month by the 15th of each succeeding month. This also shows that the order under sub- section (1) is not a final order but is preliminary to the trial of the case and is made only where the rent has in fact not been paid. For the purpose of an interim order it was not necessary that there should have been a full trial.The Rent Controller had the affidavit of the appellant and he could judge whether in the circumstances of the case, an interim order ought or ought not to be made. He came to the conclusion that the rent was not paid and the plea that it was being withheld under an agreement was an afterthought and not true. The High Court and the Rent Control Tribunal have agreed with this view of the Rent Controller and the conclusion appears to us to be sound. Once such a conclusion is reached, it is quite manifest that the order was made after affording an opportunity to the appellant to be heard. No doubt, the appellant is entitled to lead oral evidence in regard to the agreement he alleges, but for that he will have an opportunity hereafter. At the moment, he is being asked to deposit the arrears in court, which admittedly are outstanding.Mr. Desai next contended that the notice under s. 46(5A) amounted to a garnishee order and the appellant could not, while the notice stood, make any payment without incurring personal liability. There was no question of a personal liability because the Rent Controller had stated in his order that the amount would not be paid to anyone till the clearance certificate was obtained from the Income-tax Department. The Rent Controller had informed the income-tax authorities and the appellant ran no risk in depositing the arrears of rent in the circumstances.191 It was contended that the notice under s. 46(5A) -amounted to an attachment of the rent in the hands of the -appellant and reference was made to the provisions of s. 46 sub-s. 5A para 5. The argument overlooks the next para which provides:\"Where a person to whom a notice under this subsection is sent objects to it on the ground that the sum demanded or any part thereof is not due to the assessee or that he does not hold any money for or on account of the assessee, then, nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to require such person to pay any such sum or part thereof, as the case may be, to the Income-tax Officer.\" -If there was an agreement between the parties and Kirori Mal was indebted for such a large amount, the appellant could have objected on the ground that he did not hold any money for or on account of the assessee and then he would not have been required to pay any sum to the Income-tax ,Officer. The appellant did nothing in the matter except to deny the payment to everyone. He paid nothing to the Income-tax Officer, declined to deposit the money before the Rent Controller and refused to recognise the demands by the Receiver and his landlord. In other words, be was trying to take full advantage of the law, when lie could have informed the Income-tax Officer about his own position and paid the money to the Rent Controller subject to its being paid to the Income-tax Department.Reference was made in this connection to a decision of the Calcutta High Court reported in Nalinakhya Bysack and another v. Shyam Sunder Halder and others(1) in which Harries C. J. observed that before making an ,order for the deposit of the rent, a full enquiry should be made. That was a case in which the tenant had pleaded that there was an agreement between him and the landlord -that any amount spent on repairs would be set off against -the rent.Harries C.J. held that without ascertaining the (1) A.I.R, (1952) Cal. 198.192 truth of the plea that a large sum had been, spent on repairs, an order to deposit the entire arrears of rent ought not to have been made. It is quite clear that the facts there were entirely different. Payment by the landlord for repairs was a part of the tenancy agreement and rent under that tenancycould not be calculated without advertence to every term of the agreement of tenancy. Here the special agreement which is pleaded is outside the tenancy agreement and the allegation about the special agreement has been held to bean after-thought and false. It is therefore difficult to apply the ruling to the present circumstances.The appeal is wholly devoid of merit and it is dismissed with costs. By the consent of parties, a period of two months from the date of hearing (20-12-1963) was granted to the appellant to deposit the arrears of rent from 1st.April, 1958, in the Court of the Rent Controller.Appeal dismissed..LIIofIndia: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback\n",

      "The third respondent was declared elected to the Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh in the general election held in 1962. The appellant, a voter of the constituency filed an election petition challenging 214 the election of the third respondent on several grounds including corrupt practices. The petition was accompanied by the requisite number of copies which were true copies and each of them bore the signature of the petitioner. But there was no attestation at the foot of the copies that they were true copies. The third respondent raised various preliminary objections and the Election Tribunal rejected all of them. Thereupon he filed writ petition in the High Court praying for the issue of a writ quashing the Tribunal's order. His main contention was that since the copies of the petition did not contain an attestation stating that the copies were true copies there has been a violation of the mandatory provision of s. 80(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The High Court accepted the contention and issued a writ as prayed for.The present appeal was filed with special leave granted by this Court. \n",

Chaudhury and T. V. R. Tatachari, for the appellant.215 H.N. Sanyal, Solicitor-General and P. Ram Reddy, for respondent No. 3.January 13, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by- AYYANGAR J.-This is an appeal by special leave against a judgment of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh by which a Writ Petition filed by the 3rd Respondent-K. Brahmananda Reddy- was allowed and an Election Petition filed by the appellant was directed to be dismissed.The facts giving rise to the proceedings with which the appeal is concerned are briefly as follows: At the General Elections held in the month of February 1962 for the Legis- lative Assembly-Constituency of Phirangipuram in Guntur District in Andhra Pradesh-the third respondent Brahamananda Reddy and one Chandramouli, the 2nd respondent before us, were the contesting candidates. The polling at the Election took place on the 26th February 1962 and the Returning Officer declared Brahmananda Reddy, elected as having obtained, the majority of valid votes. Thereafter, the appellant who is a voter on the rolls of the said Consti- tuency filed an Election Petition before the Election Com- mission on April. 11, 1962 under s. 81 of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1951, which we shall refer to as the Act. There was no formal defect in the petition, it was accompanied by the requisite number of copies provided for by the Act and also by the treasury receipt evidencing the deposit of the requisite sum for security as provided by S.117 of the Act. The grounds on. which the election was sought to be set aside were various and included inter alia allegations of corrupt practices against the returned candi- date as well as his election agent, as also several irregularities in the polling by having the votes of dead voters recorded as well as by double voting. 'Me petition was received by the Commission, who after satisfying itself that it was in conformity with the Act had a copy of the petition published in the Official Cazette on May 17, 1962 as provided by s. 86 of the Act. In due course, an Election Tribunal was constituted and the petition was referred to the Tribunal for trial. The returned candidate-Brahmananda Reddy-filed 216 his Written Statement on September 15, 1962 in which the allegations of fact made in the petition were denied. Be- sides what might be termed the merits of the allegations in the election petition, Brahmanda Reddy raised by his Written Statement several technical objections pointing out certain defects in the petition. This appeal is not concerned either with these technical defects in the election petition or with the defence raised on the merits to the charges that were formulated in it. The merits have yet to be tried, and as regards the technical objections to the petition raised in the Written Statement dated September 15, 1962, they have been disposed of by the High Court and the same are not before us. A few days later on September 24, 1962, Brahmananda Reddy filed a further Statement of objections to the petition raising mostly objections of a technical nature and of these the only objections which is the subject matter of the present appeal is that contained in paragraph 2 which reads, and we quote the material words:\"It is further submitted on behalf of the 1st respondent that the above petition filed u/s 81 of the Act is not an Election Petition............ As the requirements of s.81(3) of the Act are not complied with, the petition is, therefore, liable to be dismissed u/s 90(3) of the Act as it does not comply with the provisions of sec. 81 of the Act..............This second statement contained a prayer that in view of the technical objections, the maintainability of the petition might be decided as a preliminary issue as the objections went into the root of the matter.Paragraph (2) extracted earlier is somewhat vague but in the arguments before the Tribunal it was explained as indicating an objection alleging non-compliance with s. 81 (3) of the Act which runs:\"Every election petition shall be accompained by as many copies thereof as there are respondents. mentioned in the petition and one more copy for the use of the Election Commission, 217 and every such copy shall be attested by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition.\" We shall refer later to the precise defect which was relied on in support of the case that there was a non-compliance with this provision. The Tribunal acceded to this request and by its order dated November 7, 1962, it decided the preliminary objections including the one just now mentioned in favour of the election petitioner and fixed a date for the trial of the petition on the merits.Brahmananda Reddy thereupon moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution and prayed for the issue of the Writ quashing this decision of the Tribunal and sought the dismissal of the election petition for non-compliance with the provisions of the Act. The learned Judges of the High Court disallowed the other technical objections raised, but held that the petition did not comply with the requirements of s. 81(3) of the Act and for this reason they, directed the dismissal of the Election Petition. Ile appellant thereafter has filed this appeal after obtaining special leave from this Court.The subject of controversy in this appeal lies in a very narrow compass. But before we deal with it, it will be convenient to specify the precise defect which the learned Judges have held to be fatal to the maintainability of the Election Petition. As stated earlier, the Election Petition filed was accompanied by the number of copies required to accompany the petition under s. 81(3). The Election Petition was type-written and the copies which accompanied the petition were carbon copies of the type-script, so there was no question of the copies being other than 'true' copies. The copies bore two signature in original of the Election Petitioner authenticating both the contents of the petition as well as the verification thereof. The Petitioner did not however insert the words 'true copy' before or above his signatures. The learned Judges of the High Court considered that this rendered the petition one not in accordance with s. 81(3) of the Act and it is on this ground that the Election, Petition filed by the appellant has been dismissed and it is the correctness of this decision that is convassed in the appeal before us.In view of the arguments addressed to us it would be necessary to set out a few of the relevant provisions of the, Act which bear upon the points urged, but before doing so we shall refer to Art. 329 of the Constitution which pro- vides:\"................329(b) no election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by the appropriate Legislature.\" In accordance with this. we have the provisions of the Act and, particularly those contained in Part VI commencing with s. 79. Section 80 repeats the provision in the Constitution already extracted and enacts :\"No election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part.\" Section 81 deals with the presentation of petitions. It runs:\"81. Presentation of petitions. (1) An election petition calling in question any election may be presented on one or more of the grounds specified in sub-section (i) of section 100 and section 101 to the Election Commission by any candidate at such election or any elector within forty-five days from, but not earlier than, the date of election of the returned candidate, or if there are more than one returned candidate at the election and the dates of their election are different, the later of those two dates.219 Explanation. In this sub-section, 'elector' means a person who was entitled to vote at the election to which the election petition relates, whether he has voted at such election or not.(2) An election petition shall be deemed to have been presented to the Election.Commission:- (a) when it is delivered to the Secretary to the Commission or to such other officer as may be appointed by the Election Commission in this behalf- (i) by the person making the petition, or (ii)by a person authorised in writing in this behalf by the person making the petition;or (b) when it is sent by registered post and is deli- vered to the Secretary to the Commission or- the officer so appointed.(3) Every election petition shall be accompanied by as many copies thereof as there are respondents mentioned in the petition and one more copy for the use of the Election Commission, and, every such copy shall be attested by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition.\" Before, proceeding further it is necessary to advert to the history of the provision in sub-section (3) for learned counsel for the respondents laid some store by the object with which the provision was introduced. As enacted in 1951, s. 81 contained only two sub-sections, the first deal- ing with the time within which a petition had to be filed and the second with the person or authority and the manner in which the petition had to be presented in order to cons- titute the presentation one to the Election Commission. At that date the Election Commission, after scrutinizing the petitions to ascertain whether there were any formal defects, had itself to make copies for being served on the respondents. To avoid this trouble and inconvenience to the Commission and the delay which the making of such copies 220 necessarily involved, sub-section (3) which we have set out earlier was introduced into s. 81 by an amendment affected by Act XL of 1961. The point made, based on this feature, we shall reserve for later discussion.Section 82 deals with the parties who are to be impleaded in the petition and s. 83 with the contents of the petition.section 83(1)(c) enacts:\"An election petition shall be signed by the petitioner and verified in the manner laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, for the verification of pleadings.\" subsection (2) requires a similar signature and verification of schedules or annexures to the petition.Section 85 empowers the Election Commission to dismiss a petition in certain contingencies. It reads:\"85. If the provisions of section 81 or section 82 or section 117 have not been complied with, the Election Commissi on shall dismiss the petition:Provided that the petition shall not be dismissed without giving the petitioner an opportunity of being heard.\" The succeeding sections deal with the trial of Election Petitions, after making provision for the appointment of an Election Tribunal by s. 86 but what is relevant in the pre- sent context is s. 90 and it is enough to quote the material words:(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any rules made thereunder, every election petition shall be tried by the Tribunal, as nearly as may be, in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, to the trial of suits:Sub-section (3) reads:The Tribunal shall dismiss an election petition which does not comply with the provisions of 221 section 81, notwithstanding that it has not been dismissed by the Election Commission under s. 85.\" The reasoning on which the learned Judges have based their decision shortly stated is this. It is the requirement of s. 81(3) of the Act that an election petition should be accompanied by the number of copies specified there, and equally so that the copies so accompanying \"shall be attest- ed by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition\". There was, of course, the signature of the petitioner on the copies, but there was no attestation by him that \"it was a true copy\". This constituted a noncompliance with the requirements of s. 81 which brought into play the terms of s. 90(3) of the Act which required the Tribunal to dismiss a petition which did not comply with the provisions of s. 81.Though the learned counsel for the appellant made several submissions, we propose to deal with only one, as the same is sufficient for the disposal of this appeal. This was that in the circumstances of the case there had been a sub- stantial compliance with the requirements of s. 81(3).Before, however, dealing with it, it will be convenient to refer to some of the submissions made to us by the learned Solicitor-General appearing for the contesting respondents.'He submitted to us certain propositions which however we consider really unexceptionable. He said that an election petition was not to be equated to an action at law or in equity, but that as the rights were purely the creature of statute, if the statute rendered any particular requirement mandatory, the courts possessed and could exercise no dis- pensing power to waive non-compliance. We consider these propositions are sound and it is in the light of these basic positions that we shall proceed to consider whether the ,omission to add the words \"true copy\" in the copies which were admittedly exact copies of the petition, constituted a non-compliance with s. 81 (3) as to render the petition liable to be rejected under s. 90(3) of the Act.Learned counsel for the appellant urged that the juris- diction of the Tribunal under s. 90(3) to dismiss 'an ele- 222 tion petition which does not comply with the provisions of s. 81' was attracted only if there was a defect in the peti- tion itself and that a defect merely in the copy accompanying the petition would not be a case of a \"petition not complying with the provisions of s. 81\" so as to require or even permit the Tribunal to dismiss the petition. In support of this submission, the difference in the language employed in s. 85 and s. 90(3) of the Act in the matter of making reference to the requirements of s. 81 was adverted to. Besides, it was pointed out that both s. 90(3) and before it s. 90(4) were in their present form making refer- ence to s. 81 when the latter section did not contain the third sub-section relating to copies accompanying the petition, and that the content of s. 90(3) should not be held enlarged because in 1961 sub-section (3) was added to s. 81 particularly because the language of s. 90(3) was not altered to reflect the change.We are not impressed by this argument. When s. 81 (3) requires an election petition to be accompanied by the requisite number of copies, it became a requirement for the presentation of the election petition to the Commission, and therefore a condition precedent for the proper presentation of an election petition. If that is a requirement of s. 81, no distinction can be drawn between the requirements of sub- sections (1) and (2) and of sub-section (3). We might add that if there is a total and complete non-compliance with the provisions of s. 81(3), the election petition might not be \"an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part\" within s. 80 of the Act. We are therefore inclined to consider that if there had been such a non-compliance with the requirement of sub-section (3) not merely the Election Commission under s. 85 but the Election Tribunal under s. 90(3) would prima facie not merely be justified but would be required 'to 'dismiss the election petition.This takes us to the point as to whether the requirement of s. 81(3) has been complied with or not. The principal submission of the learned Solicitor-General was based the language employed in s. 81(3) of the Act read in 223 the light of the direction contained in s. 90(3) which cast on the Tribunal the duty to dismiss an election petition which did not conform to the requirements of the former. In particular, he laid stress on the use of the imperative 'shall in s. 81(3) when denoting the requirement of \"attes- tation\" \"under the petitioner's signature\" of the copy bearing the signature being a \"true copy\". It was in this connection that he pointed out that the provision for properly attested copies of the petition accompanying the petition was introduced by the amendment effected in 1961, and the object of Parliament was two-fold; first to save the time and inconvenience which the previous procedure cast on the Election Commission, of itself having to make copies for service on the respondents, and secondly by this means to expedite the conclusion of the trial of an election petition. He submitted that the attainment of these objects would be entirely frustrated if the respondents on whom these copies were served had still to make enquiries to satisfy themselves whether the copies were true copies, without the same being asserted to be so on their face. In support he referred us to the decisions in Noseworthy v.Overseers of Buckland etc. (1) and in Spice v. Bacon (2 ) as illustrating the degree of strictness and literal compliance which was insisted on by courts in regard to provisions of like character.The first of these cases was a registration appeal and the Act provided that a person who objected to a voter's quali- fication might be heard in support of his objection if he had given notice to the voter and the manner of giving notice was by sending it by post addressed to his place of abode \"as described\". It was held that a notice by post addressed correctly but not to the address \"as described\" was not a compliance with 'the requirement and that in consequence the objector could not be heard. We do not consider that this decision lays down any hard and fast rule or principle of construction which is attracted 'to every case where a statute calls for interpretation. In ultimate analysis the question is one of the construction of the relevant provision of the particular statutes which proceeds on the basis. of the words used understood in the context of the statute.(1) [1873] UKLawRpCP 65; L.R. 9 C. P. 233.(2) L.R. a Ex. D. 463.224 The second case raised a question as to the meaning of the word \"true copy\" in the Inn-keepers' Liability Act 1863, which required that in order to obtain the benefit of the limitation of liability conferred by the Act, a \"copy\" of the Act had to be exhibited at the Inn. The copy which was exhibited omitted some material words of the section which was required to be exhibited. The Court held that when a claim was made on the inn-keeper for loss sustained by a guest, he could not claim the benefit of the statute. We are unable to appreciate the relevance of this decision. It turned on what was meant by the word 'copy' in the Act and the portion which was omitted in the copy exhibited was a material portion. There is no doubt that such a 'copy' which differs in material particular from the original is not a `copy' within the Act. In this connection we might make a reference to the decision of this Court in Murarka v. Roop Singh(1) where the question as to what is a \"copy\" is elaborately discussed and some of the English decisions touching this matter have been set out. We shall have occasion to refer to Murarka's case later, but for the present we need only add that the decision relied on by the Solicitor-General is not at variance with what this Court has laid down in Murarka's case.The next matter to be considered stems from the submission as regards the object of Parliament in enacting sub-section (3) of s. 81 and that expeditious disposal of election petitions which was the object would be frustrated if sub- stantial compliance with the provision was held sufficient.We are not impressed with this argument. While we are conscious of the need for expeditious disposal of election petitions, and for the strict enforcement of provisions designed to achieve this purpose, we cannot be oblivious to the circumstance that to read every requirement literally might equally defeat the purpose for which Part VI is inten- ded, viz., that elections are conducted in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions framed to ensure purity and orderliness and that the candidate who has not obtained a majority of valid votes or has obtained it in flagrant (1) [1963] INSC 136; [1964] 3 S.C.R. 573 225 breach of the statutory provisions in not held entitled to represent the constituency.The Court had to deal with a similar question of inter- pretation of words which appeared mandatory in Kamaraj Nadar v. Kunju Thevar(1). One of the points which arose for consideration was whether the requirement of s. 117 of the Act which then required the petitioner to enclose with the petition a Government treasury receipt of Rs. 100 in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission had been complied with by the election petitioner and s. 90(4) of the Act which corresponded substantially to the present s. 90(3) required the Election Tribunal to dismiss a petition which did not comply with the provision, inter alia, of s. 117.The petitioner in that case had made the deposit of the requisite amount in the institutions named in the section but the deposit was made in favour of the Election Commission and not in favour of the Secretary to the Com- mission as required by statute. It was contended that the petition did not conform to the provisions of s. 117 and had therefore to be dismissed by the Tribunal. This Court rejected this submission and after adverting to the purpose of the provisions, held that this was fulfilled by the deposit made and that though the requirement as to deposit was mandatory, the same was complied with by the deposit made.We consider that this reasoning is not irrelevant to the construction of s. 81(3) of the Act either.In this connection we might refer to the decision of this Court in Murarka v. Roop Singh (2) in which this Court had to consider a question closely related to that now under debate. That case was also concerned with certain defects similar to what we have in the appeal before us. The defects which were there relied on by the returned candidate as justifying or requiring the dismissal of the Election Petition fell into several categories which included non- compliance with the requirements of s. 81(3). There, as here, the petition was accompanied with the re- (1)[1959] S.C.R. 583. (2) [1963] INSC 136; [1964] 3 S.C.R. 573.134--159 S.C--15 226 quisite number of copies as specified in s. 81(3) but what was urged was as regards certain defects in the copies filed. These defects fell into two types. First there were two matters which it was stated rendered the copies filed not 'true copies'. If the expressions 'copy' or 'true copy' were read as exact copies of the original, the copies filed did not satisfy that test. The two defects were: (1) The original petition contained the signature of the petitioner at the foot of the petition as required by s. 83 (1) (c) of the Act. In the copy filed there was no copy of this signature. To that extent therefore the copy was not an exact copy.The second matter under this head was that the verification in the copy served on the appellant did not exactly correspond to that in the original in that in the latter one of the paragraphs was stated to be true to the personal knowledge of the petitioner while in the former that paragraph was omitted from this group.The other type of defect which was claimed to constitute noncompliance with s. 81(3) was that the words 'true copy' with the signature of the petitioner underneath were not put down in one of the annexures to the petition, copies of which were annexed to the copies of the petition filed. The order of the Returning Officer rejecting the nomination paper of the petitioner was filed with the original petition as an annexure to it, and certified copies of that order were annexed to the copies of the petition. But this certified copy did not contain an endorsement stating that it was a 'true copy' with the signature of the petitioner.The High Court had held that so far as the defect in not reproducing the signature in the petition was concerned, it was cured by the fact that every page of the copy of the petition was attested to be a true copy and therefore it would not matter if the last page did not contain the signature. As regards the second, the High Court held that the failure to include the paragraph in the verification was only a clerical defect which had crept in through oversight and as regards the other that it was no defect at all. This decision was upheld by this Court holding that the word copy in s. 81(3) meant a copy which was substantially so and which did not 227 contain any material or substantial variation. By 'copy' in s. 81(3) was meant not an exact copy but only one so true that nobody by any possibility misunderstands it not being the same as the original. Applying this test, this .Court came to the conclusion that there was no failure to comply with the last part of s. 81(3), with the result that s. 90(3) of the Act was not attracted.This Court besides left open the question as to whether any part of s. 81(3) was directory or whether any portion of it was mandatory. In the present case also, we do not propose to deal with the larger question as to whether s.81(3) or any portion of it is merely directory. In view of the decision of this Court it would be clear that if there is a substantial compliance with the requirement of s.81(3), the election petition cannot be dismissed by the Tribunal under s. 90(3). The question then is whether on the facts above-stated, there is or is not a sufficient and substantial compliance with s. 81(3). We have already pointed out that the appellant has complied with the following requirements:(1) The petition has been accompanied by the requisite number of copies.(2) The copies that accompanied the petition were true copies.(3) Each of those copies bore the signatures of the petitioner.If the signature of the petitioner whose name is set out in the body of the petition is appended at the end, surely it authenticates the contents of the document. Now in regard to this the learned Judges of the High Court themselves ob- served after referring to the terms of s. 81(3):\"No doubt, what is necessary is a substantial compliance with the requirement of attestation. For instance, if it is proved that the election petitioner has signed animo attestendi, and omitted the words 'true copy' by mistake or inadvertently, there is a substantial requirement of the compliance of s. 81(3). The 228 same may be said if the relative positions of the words 'true copy' and of the signature one below the other are not correct.\" They however held that as there was no evidence of the sig- nature having been appended animo attestendi, there was non- compliance with s. 81(3). The learned Solicitor-General while not disputing the correctness of the observations of the learned Judges just extracted pressed upon us that the signature at the end of the copy was meant only as a copy of that in the original petition and could not satisfy the requirement as to attestation of the copy. He also submitted that the position would have been different if there were two signatures instead of one at the end of the copy, even if the words 'true copy' were omitted to be put down. In that case, he said, one signature could be treated as representing the copy of the signature on the original and the other might be taken to have been made animo attestendi. We do not however consider that there is really need for so much refinement when one has to look at whether there is a substantial compliance with s. 81(3), seeing that a signature in origisignatures now found on the copies were intended to authenticate the document to which it is appended, viz., the copy, it would only mean that the copy did not reproduce the signature in the original. There is no compelling necessity to hold that the signatures were merely intended to be a copy of those on the original in order to spell out a noncompliance with the requirement of this provision. If the nal was not needed on the copy and a writing copying out the name of the signatory would suffice.The decision of this Court in Murarka's case(1) is authority for the position that the absence of a writing in the copy indicating the signature in the original would not detract the copy from being a true copy. In the circumstances, we consider that there has been substantial compliance with the requirement of s. 81(3) in the petition that was filed by the appellant and the learned Judges were in error in directing the dismissal of the petition.The appeal is accordingly allowed and the order of the High Court dismissing the petition is set aside. As owing (1)[1964] 3 S. R. 573 229 to the filing of the Writ Petition there has been a considerable delay in the trial of the Election Petition, we express the hope that the petition would be heard and disposed of at an early a date as is conveniently possible.The appellant will be entitled to his costs here and in the High Court which will be paid by the contesting third respondent.Appeal Allowed.LIIofIndia: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback\n",

The additional allegation about possession in October 1934 did not really destroy the basic and substantial identity of the ,causes of action in the two suits.The ban imposed by 0.

The word \"plaintiff\" in the rule includes his assigns and legal representatives.(ii)that when the Government granted the lease in 1928, the lease was granted not only in favour of Ismail but also in favour of the ,other co-sharers although the name of Ismail alone was mentioned in the lease deed.

T. Desai and B. P. Maheshwari, for the appellants.B. Sen, N. R. Ghosh, Salil K. Datt and P. K. Ghosh, for the respondents Nos. 1 and 2.January 13, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AYYANGAR J.-This is an appeal preferred, by virtue of a certificate of fitness granted by the Calcutta High Court, against its judgment, by which the decree passed by the Subordinate Judge of Darjeeling was substantially affirmed.The plaintiffs are the appellants before this Court. The suit out of which the appeal arises was brought by the appellants claiming title to and the recovery of possession of a property known as the Azambad Tea Estate which comprised about 378 acres of land in Touzi No. 911 of the Darjeeling Collectors. This property was set out in Schedule A to the plaint and besides a claim was also made to certain other items of the movable and certain other tenures, but this appeal is not concerned with these others which were set out. in Schs. B and C to the plaint.195 One Kazi Azam Ali was admittedly a full owner of this entire property and the proceedings giving rise to the appeal are concerned with the rights of his heirs to it. The plain- tiffs claim their title on the basis of various purchases from the heirs of this Azam Ali. The contesting defendants were the Azamabad Tea Co. who also claim the entire property as transferees from the National Agency Co. Ltd., who too have been impleaded as defendants. The National Agency Co.Ltd. claim to have purchased the entire 16 as. interest in the property at a Court sale in pursuance of a decree obtained by them against Kazi Mohammed Ismail, the eldest son of Azam Ali. Various contentions were raised by the plaintiffs in challenge of the validity of the transactions by which the defendants claimed their title. But the learned Subordinate Judge repelled the plaintiffs' claim and held that the purchase by the National Agency Co. Ltd. was valid and extended to the entire interest in the property and that in consequence the plaintiffs' vendors had no title to convey to them any interest in the property. The plaintiffs' claim of the property in respect of Sch. A was therefore dismissed. The plaintiffs preferred an appeal to the High Court and the learned Judges upheld the title of the plaintiffs to an 8 pies share in the property mentioned in Sch. A to the plaint but confirmed the decree of the Subordinate Judge as regards the rest. The learned Judges however granted a certificate of fitness to the plaintiffs on the strength of which the present appeal has been filed.The history of the transactions before the suit occupies a period of over 20 years and the facts in relation thereto are at once long, voluminous and complicated. But, for the disposal of the appeal and the points urged before us it is wholly unnecessary to set these out and we shall therefore confine ourselves to a narration of the bare outlines of the case along with those facts which are necessary to appreciate the contentions raised in support of the appeal.The property covered by the Tea Estate was granted by Government by way of lease to one Mudir and another for 30 years, the term to start on the 1st of April 1898. The grantees effected transfers of their lease-hold and after several successive transfers the property was purchased in 196 1913 by one Kazi Azam Ali who got his name registered as a proprietor. It was Azam Ali who started the tea garden.constructed the requisite factories as accessories thereto and named it the Azamabad Tea Estate. Azam Ali had several children and among them 8 daughters and in consideration of gifts made to them, these daughters by a registered deed executed in 1909 relinquished their rights of succession to Azam Ali. They thus faded away from the picture and no more notice need be taken of them. Besides these 8 daughters, Azam Ali had 8 sons who survived him and were among his heirs, when he died on June 8, 1917. Mohammed Ismail was the eldest of these sons. Azam Ali also left behind him a daughter who was born after' the relinquishment of 1909 and three widows. Admittedly the sons of Azam Ali, his widows and his last daughters were all his heirs entitled to his estate in the shares as prescribed by Muslim Law. On Azam Ali's death his eldest son--Ismail-had his name entered in the Government records as the next in succession and at the time the thirty years term of the lease expired, the lease continued to remain in the name of Ismail alone.We now proceed to the transactions as a result of which the contesting defendants claim to have obtained the full title to the Tea Estate. Ismail made large borrowings and among them were some from the National Agency Co. Ltd. and for securing the loan he deposited with them the title deeds of the Tea Estate. It may be mentioned that the deposit was on the footing that he was the full owner of the 16 as. share of the property mortgaged. The amount due under the mortgage was not paid in time and the mortgagee filed a suit for the enforcement of its mortgage and prayed for the sale of the property for the realisation of the mortgage money.The suit was decreed as prayed for and the property was sold in execution of the final decree and was purchased by the mortgage-decree holder on September 24, 1931. The sale was confirmed on November 13, 1931. This decree-holder purchaser sold the property to the Azamabad Tea Estate--the principal respondent before is. There was some little controversy as regards the reality and effectiveness of the transfer of the property from the National Agency Co. Ltd.to the Azamabad Tea Estate, 197 but nothing turns on this, for even if that transfer was not effective that would not help the plaintiffs so long as they could not displace the title of the National Agency Co. Ltd.under the latter's court auction purchase.The case of the plaintiffs rested on the fact that Ismail who got himself registered as if he were a full proprietor of the lease-hold interest in Touzi 911 was merely one of several co-sharers of Azam Ali's estate to whom it passed on his death. The lease-hold which was his property was according to them inherited by all his heirs including Ismail, the seven other sons, the three widows and the daughter born after 1909.The term of the lease granted by the Government expired in 1928 and a renewed lease was granted in the name of Ismail alone. Rival contentions were urged as regards the effect of this circumstance on the right of Ismail. It was the case of the contesting respondents that the lease granted in 1928 in favour of Ismail was his sole and individual pro- perty and even if for any reason the other heirs of Azam Ali had an interest in the previous lease-hold, they did not have any such interest in the property covered by the fresh lease. On the other hand, the case of the plaintiffs was that by the renewal of the lease, Ismail obtained qua his co-heirs the same interest as he formerly had in the lease of 1898. The renewal, they stated, was for the benefit not merely of Ismail but for everyone of his co-heirs who still retained his or her interest in Azam Ali's estate. On this basis the plaintiffs raised the contentions that when by the sale in execution of the mortgage decree obtained by the National Agency Co. they purchased the property mortgaged, it was only the interest of Ismail that passed to them and not those of his co-sharers who were no parties to the mortgage, There is one further transaction to which we must advert before passing on to the next stage of the proceedings.After the mortgage by deposit of title deeds in favour of the National Agency Co., Ismail transferred his entire interest in the mortgaged property, that is, in the equity of redemption, to his wife Mst. Nazifannessa, by a deed dated May 6, 1930. Notwithstanding this deed and this transfer of the equity of redemption Mst. Nazifannessa was not made a party to the 198 mortgage suit by the National Agency Co. The plaintiffs who claim to have acquired Mst. Nazifannessa's interest contended that by reason of the failure to implead Nazifannessa in the mortgage action, her right to redeem the mortgage was still in tact in spite of the mortgage decree and the sale in pursuance thereof, and on this footing made a claim in the alternative to redeem the mortgage in favour of the National Agency Co. and obtain possession after re- demption.To complete the narrative of the relevant facts, very soon after the purchase in Court auction in execution of the mortgage decree, the heirs of Azam Ali brought a suit (58 of 1931) to set aside the decree and the sale in favour of the National Agency Co. Ltd. on various grounds--collusion, fraud, the circumstance that Ismail was merely a co-sharer entitled to about 2 1/2 as. share in the property and so could not mortgage more than that share, and that the decree could not bind a larger interest nor the sale convey anything more than that share, even if it conveyed any title to the property. This suit however did not proceed to trial, but was dismissed for default, in that the plaintiffs did not appear in Court on the date fixed for trial. The only other matter to be mentioned is that the plaintiffs have, by their purchases, acquired from the several co- heirs, directly or mediately, the entire 16 as. share in the property assuming that their vendors had any such right.Armed with these purchases the plaintiffs filed this suit for the reliefs already indicated.The defences raised to the suit were three- fold:(1) That Ismail was the sole proprietor of the Tea Estate at the date of the mortgage and consequently the entire interest was the subject of mortgage and so passed at the court sale. This was based on the provisions of the Crown Grants Act, now the Government Grants Act. It would be recollected that the thirty years lease of Touza 911 was renewed in 1928 and this renewal was made in the name of Ismail alone. Based on this feature a contention was raised that the grant of the lease created a new title in the grantee since the original lease in 199 which alone the heirs of Azam Ali might have had a share was extinguished by the termination of that lease by efflux of time.(2) The second line of defence was that Ismail, even if in fact or law was not the full owner, was an ostensible owner of the entire interest in the property and that the co-heirs were estopped from questioning the validity of the mortgage of the entire interest effected by him under s. 41 of the Transfer of Property Act and that in conse- quence the sale in execution passed the entire 16 as. share to the purchaser.(3) Lastly, it was urged that the plaintiffs' suit was liable to be dismissed by reason of the provisions of 0. IX, r. 9 of the Civil Procedure Code as the earlier Original Suit 58 of 1931 brought by the co-heirs to set aside the sale under the mortgage decree had been allowed to be dismissed for default.The learned Judges of the High Court rejected the first two of the defences but held that except to the extent of an eight pies share which represented the interest of a co-heir which was not affected by the proceeding in Suit 58 of 1931, the plaintiffs were precluded by 0. IX. r. 9, Civil Procedure Code from disputing the sale in execution of mortgage decree by reason of the dismissal for default of Suit 5 8 of 1931.Before proceeding to set out the arguments addressed to us by Mr. Desai, learned counsel for the appellants, it might be convenient to dispose of the submissions made to us by Mr. Sen, learned counsel for the respondents, seeking to ,sustain the first two defences which were repelled by the High Court.The first of them was that by reason of the renewal of the lease in 1928 in the name of Ismail and the entry of his name as sole lessee in the revenue records, the leasehold became his sole property. Apart from the arguments about Ismail being the ostensible owner of the entire 16 as. share in the lease-hold under the lease of 1898-which we shall consider a little later-Mr. Sen did not dispute that 200 Ismail's co-heirs were entitled to their fractional shares in the property under the original lease. The acceptability of this argument regarding the renewed lease has to be determined on -the basis of two factors-first the intention of the parties, and here primarily of the grantor, as to the nature and quantum of the title intended to be conferred on or obtained by Ismail and, second, the provisions of the Crown, Grants Act which governed the grant on which reliance was placed as leading to that result. First, as to the intention of the parties. The original lease of 1898 was due to expireon March 31, 1928. On July 20, 1928 Mohd.Ismail made a petition to the Deputy Commissioner, Darjeeling by which after drawing the latter's attention to the date on which the lease was to expire, he \"respectfully solicited the favour of' kindly granting a further lease of the said Estate for a further period of 30 years.\" The Deputy Commissioner replied by letter dated August 10, 1928 sending Ismail the draft of the renewed lease for his approval and return adding \"in the record of rights the following names have been recorded:1. Kazi Mohammed Ismail 2 as.;2. Kazi Isahaque 2 as.;3. Kazi Yakub 2 as.;4. Kazi Samoddoha 2 as.;5. Kazi Nurul Huda 2 as.;6. Kazi Badarudduza 2 as.;7. Kazi Insaf Ali 2 as.;8. Kazi Asfaque 2 as.;Please mention the name in whose favour the lease will have to be issued.\" Ismail returned the draft lease with his approval but desired that the lease should be issued according to the name in the land register. We are unable to read this request as meaning that Ismail, contradicting what the Government said, wanted that the leasehold interest should be his sole property in which his co-heirs who had interest in the earlier lease were to be denied all beneficial interest. It was thereafter that the lease was executed on February 1, 1929 in the name of Ismail to be operative from April 1, 1928 and was in terms in renewal of the previous 201 lease. In the circumstance, we are satisfied that the Gov- ernment intended to grant a lease in favour of his co- sharers as well, though the lease deed was in the name of Ismail alone. If Ismail intended to benefit himself at the expense of his co-sharers and as we have said, we do not read his reply to the Deputy Commissioner as disclosing such an intention, the same was not made known to the Government.We are therefore unable to accept Mr. Sen's submission based on the intention of the parties. He, however, submitted that whatever be the intention of the parties, by reason of s. 3 of the Crown Grants Act Ismail's title to the full 16 as. share in the leasehold could not be disputed. This section reads:\"3. All provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations over contained in any such grant or transfer as aforesaid shall be valid and take effect according to (their tenor, any rule of law, statute or enactment of the Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding.\" If, as we have held. it was the intention of the Government in granting the renewal that the co-heirs too should have the benefit of the lease we do not see how these provisions affect their beneficial interest in the lease. Nor are thereany clauses in the lease which preclude the existence of abeneficial interest in persons other than the lessee named.This point is therefore without substance and is rejected.The next point urged was based on s. 41 of the Transfer of Property Act. It was said that Ismail was by reason of the entry in the revenue registers, which the co-heirs did nothing to correct, ostensibly the full owner of the property and hence the mortgage by him as full owner and the sale in court auction in execution of the decree by the National Agency Co. Ltd. passed the full title to the Tea Estate and that the co-heirs were consequently estopped from disputing the defendant's right to the full 16 as. share in the property.In order that s. 41 of the Transfer of Property Act could be attracted, the respondents should prove that Ismail was the ostensible owner of the property with the consent of his co- sharers and besides that they took reason-able care 202 to ascertain whether Ismail had the power to make a transfer of the full 16 as. interest. Now, the facts however were that except the property being entered in the revenue records in Ismail's name, and that the management of the property was left by the co-sharers with Ismail, there is not an iota of evidence to establish that Ismail was put forward by them as the ostensible owner of the property. It is manifest that the conduct of co-sharers in permitting one of them to manage the common property does not by itself raise any estoppel precluding them from asserting their rights. The learned Judges have also pointed out that even the least enquiry by the mortgagee would have disclosed that Ismail was not the full owner and this finding was not seriously challenged before us. In this view it is unnecessary for us to consider the submissions made to us by Mr. Desai that s. 41 was inapplicable to cases of sales in court auctions for the reason that what the court is capable of selling and what is sold in execution of a decree is only the right, title and interest of the judgment-debtor and nothing more. We, therefore, hold that the learned Judges of the High Court rightly held that s. 41 of the Transfer of Property Act afforded no defence to the respondents.The next and the only point remaining for consideration is whether the appellants' suit is barred under the provisions of 0. IX. r. 9, Civil Procedure Code. The part of this provision material for our purpose runs:- \"Where a suit is wholly or partly dismissed under rule 8, the plaintiff shall be precluded from bringing a fresh suit in respect of the same cause of action.\" The learned Judges of the High Court have held that this provision barred the plaintiffs' claim in the present suit except to the extent of an 8 pies share in the estate which belonged to Azifunnessa and Najifennessa, two of the daughters of Azam Ali, who on the death of their mother became entitled to that share. These two were not the parties to suit No. 58 of 1931 and hence the learned fudges held that their share (which was purchased 'by the plaintiffs) was unaffected by the dismissal of that suit.203 The decision of the High Court in regard to this 8 pies share has become final and thus is outside controversy. The ,only question is whether the plaintiffs-appellants are entitled to anything beyond this share.The suit, 58 of 1931, was instituted by 7 plaintiffs Ashfaq, Shamsuzzoha, Nurul Huda, Mohd. Yakub, these four being the sons of Azam Ali, two of his daughters Mahbuba Khatun and Habiba Khatun and one of his widows Bibi Marium. There were two defendants-the National Agency Co. Ltd. the purchaser in court sale of the property under the mortgage decree, whose title was challenged and against whom reliefs were claimed and Mohd. Ismail who was a pro forma defendant. Ashfaq, The first plaintiff, died after the institution of the suit and certain of the parties already on record were recorded as his legal representatives. The allegations in the plaint briefly were that the 2nd defendant Mohd. Ismail was not tile sole proprietor or owner of the Azamabad Tea Estate and that for that reason, the mortgage in favour of the 1st defendant, the mortgage-decree obtained by it and the sale thereunder passed to it no title except to the extent of 2- 1/2 as. share belonging to Mohd. Ismail. The plaintiffs therefore prayed for a decree declaring- (1) that Mohd. Ismail had only 2-1/2 as.share in the property and the remaining 132- 1/2 as. share belonged to the plaintiffs;(2) that only 2-1/2 as. share was sold under the mortgage decree and purchased by the National Agency Co. Ltd. at the court sale.The suit was instituted on 28th November, 1931 and after the issues were settled, the suit was posted for trial on 22nd August, 1932, on which date the plaintiffs were absent, no witnesses on their behalf were present, and their pleader reported no instructions. The suit was therefore directed to be dismissed with costs in favour of the National Agency Co. Ltd. who was the only party present in Court. It may be mentioned that Mohd. Ismail never appeared during the hearing of the suit.204 Before taking up for consideration certain points urged before us by Mr. Desai regarding the construction of 0. IX r. 9 C.P.C. we might dispose of a contention raised by him that Suit No. 58 of 1931 was filed fraudulently and collusively and the dismissal was the result of a settlement brought about collusively in order to defeat the plaintiffs' rights. We consider that there is no factual basis to sustain, this plea for he could point to no definite proof in support, and the most he could do was to refer us to certain suspicious circumstances. We cannot obviously base any decision or rest any finding, on mere suspicion and we have no hesitation in saying that the submission does not deserve serious consideration.The next submission was that even the 212 as. share of Ismail did not pass under the sale in execution of the mortgage decree, because it was said Ismail had been, adjudicated an insolvent in Insolvency Case 38 of 1931 by the Dist. Judge Purnia, as a result of which the properties which were the subject of the court-sale had vested in the official receiver before the relevant date. Though, no doubt, an allegation regarding this matter was made in the plaint and this was denied by the plaintiffs there is nothing in the judgments of the courts below or in the, evidence to indicate that the necessary facts were proved or that this point was urged with any seriousness at any stage of the proceedings until in this Court. We have therefore nothing beyond the bare allegations and denials and as the full facts in relation to this matter were not placed before the Court we hold that this plea is devoid of merits and does not merit consideration.It was next said that two of the plaintiffs in suit No. 58 of 1931, Nurul Huda and Habiba Khatun, a son and a daughter of Azam Ali were really adults but were shown in the cause title as minors represented by their respective natural guardians as their next friends and that as these adults could not in law be represented by persons purporting to act as their guardians they could not be held to be parties to the suit and hence their interests could not be affected by the dismissal of the suit. This also is one of the matters in respect of which the plaintiffs beyond a mere pleading which was denied, made no grievance in the courts 205 below and the facts in relation to this issue, namely, the age ,,of the two plaintiffs at the date of the plaint not having been clearly proved, we do not find it possible to entertain the plea at this stage.Mr. Desai, then submitted that Ashfaq who had figured as the first plaintiff in suit No. 58 of 1931 had already on April 18, 1931 transferred his 2 as. 13 gandas and odd share in Touzi No. 911 to one Pir Baksh from whom the plaintiff obtained a conveyance by a deed dated September 2, 1943 of what he had purchased from Ashfaq. For this reason he urged that on the findings on the merits of the title in favour of the plaintiffs on the first two defenses we have dealt with earlier the plaintiffs should have been granted .a decree to this share of Ashfaq in addition to the 8 pies share decreed to them by the High Court. No doubt, if this transaction were made out and was real, it would stand on the same footing as the 8 pies share in regard to which a decree was granted in favour of the plaintiffs by the judgment now under appeal. We shall however consider this matter after dealing with the point urged as regards the construction of0. IX. r. 9, Civil Procedure Code, which was his main submission and which, if upheld, would entirely eliminate the bar under this provision of law.On this the first submission was that the rule which spoke of the \"plaintiff\" being precluded from bringing a fresh suit created merely a personal bar against the plaintiff in the first suit and that in the absence of words referring to the representatives of the plaintiff or those claiming under the plaintiff as in s. 11 or s. 47 of the Civil Procedure Code, the bar was not attracted to cases where the subsequent suit was by the heirs and assigns of that plaintiff. In support of this submission Mr. Desai invited our attention to the observations of Das J. in Gopi Ram v.Jagannath Singh(1) where this argument was characterised as a weighty one and examined elaborately. Though the learned Judge decided this matter on quite a different line of reasoning, he referred to various earlier decisions which appeared to him to favour the view submitted to us by Mr.Desai and expressed his hesitation in (1) L.L.R. 9 Pat. 447 at P. 454.206 rejecting that construction. We are not however impressed by the argument that the ban imposed by 0. IX. r. 9 creates merely a personal bar or estoppel against the particular plaintiff suing on the same cause of action and leaves the matter at large for those claiming under him. Beyond the absence in 0. IX. r. 9 of the words referring \"to those claiming under the plaintiff\" there is nothing to warrant this argument. It has neither principle, nor logic to commend it. It is not easy to comprehend how A who had no right to bring a suit or rather who was debarred from bringing a suit for the recovery of property could effect a transfer of his rights to that property and confer on the transferee a right which he was precluded by law from asserting. There are, no doubt, situations where a person could confer more rights on a transferee than what he possessed but those are clearly defined exceptions which would not include the case now on hand. This argument was addressed to the High Court and the learned Judges characterised it as startling, a view which we share. The rule would obviously have no value and the bar imposed by it would be rendered meaningless if the plaintiff whose suit was dismissed for default had only to transfer the property to another and the latter was able to agitate rights which his vendor was precluded by law from putting forward. Aga- in to say that an heir of the plaintiff is in a better position than himself and that the bar lapses on a plaintiff's death, does not appeal to us as capable of being justified by any principle or line of reasoning. In our opinion, the word \"plaintiff' in the rule should obviously, in order that the bar may be effective, include his assigns and legal representatives.It was next urged that 0. IX. r. 9 precluded a second suit in respect of \"the same cause of action\" and that the cause of action on which Suit 58 of 1931 was laid and the present suit-Title suit 18 of 1943 was not the same and so, the bar was not attracted.In view of this argument it is necessary to examine them cause of action on which the present suit has been filed and compare and contrast with that in Suit 58 of 1931. Closely analysed the material allegations to found the cause of action on which reliefs were claimed in the present suit 207 were (i) That the Tea Estate was originally the property of Azam Ali. When he died his estate was inherited by his 8 sons, his widows and a daughter. That the registration of the estate in the name of Md. Ismail was as a co-sharer, the property belonging beneficially to all the heirs. This position was not altered by the termination of the first lease and its renewal in 1928 for a further period of 30 years. All the co-heirs lived as a joint family with a common mess and hence there was no question of any adverse possession by Md. Ismail whose possession was not as sole proprietor or exclusive. The suit on the mortgage was fraudulent and collusive, by Ismail colluding with the mortgagee to defraud his co-heirs. Details were mentioned as evidence of the fraud and collusion. The sale in pur- suance of the decree which was passed ex-parte was also fraudulent. On the date of the auction Ismail had no title even to the 2-1/2- as. share because of his adjudication as an insolvent earlier. The manner in which the 8 pies share of the daughters was obtained by the plaintiff was set out, and similarly the purchase by them through Pir Baksh of the share of Ashfaq. The other purchases by the plaintiffs whereby they claimed to have obtained the 16 as. share in the Tea Estate were set out. The plaint then went on to refer to suit 58 of 1931 and set out their case as regards the nature of that litigation and its effect. Lastly, they pleaded that they had obtained possession of the Tea gardens on October 10, 1934 and that on the next day the defendants moved the Magistrate for an order under s. 144, Criminal Procedure Code and that the Magistrate had made an order against the plaintiffs restraining them from interfering with the possession of the defendants which necessitated their bringing the suit for the reliefs we have set out earlier.We have already summarised the material allegations which were made in Suit 58 of 1931. The material difference between the cause of action alleged in the present suit consists only in the addition of the allegations about the possession and dispossession in October, 1934. This suit is based on the title of the plaintiffs by reason of their purchases and admittedly their vendors would have nothing to convey if the court sale conveyed, as it purported to 208 convey, the full 16 as. interest in the Tea garden to the National Agency Co. Ltd. It was because of this that allegations were made to sustain their title and this could be done only if they established want of title to the extent of 16 as share in Ismail, the consequent ineffectiveness of the mortgage effected by Ismail and of the decree obtained in pursuance thereof and of the court sale in execution of that decree, being confined at the most to 2-1/2 as. share belonging to Ismail. These allegations which were fund- amental to the plaintiffs' case were identical with those which had been made in suit No. 58 of 1931. Bearing these features in mind, the proposition that Mr. Desai submitted for our acceptance was briefly this.A cause of action is a bundle of facts on the basis of which relief is claimed. If in addition to the facts alleged in the first suit, further facts are alleged and relief sought ,on their basis also, and he explained the additional facts to be the allegations about possession and dispossession in October, 1934, then the position in law was that the entire complexion of the suit is changed with the result that the words of 0. IX. r. 9 \"in respect of the same cause of action\" are not satisfied and the plaintiff is entitled to reagitate the entire cause of action in the second suit. In support of this submission, learned counsel invited our attention to certain observation in a few decisions to which we do not consider it necessary to refer as we do not see any substance in the argument.We consider that the test adopted by the Judicial Committee for determining the identity of the cause of action in the two suits in Mohammed Khalil Khan and Ors. v.Mahbub Ali Mian and Ors. (1) is sound and expressescorrectly the proper interpretation of the provision.In that case Sir Madhavan Nair, after an exhaustive discussion of the meaning of the expression \"same cause of action\" which occurs in a similar context in para (1) of O. 11 r. 2 of the Civil Procedure Code, observed:\"In considering whether the cause of action in the subsequent suit is the same or not, as the cause of action in the previous suit, the test (1)75 1. A. 121.209 to be applied is: are the causes of action in the two suits in substance-not technically- identical?\" The learned Judge thereafter referred to an earlier decision of the Privy Council in Soorijamonee Dasee v. Suddanund(1) and extracted the following passage as laying down the approach to the question :\"Their Lordships are of opinion that the term 'cause of action' is to be construed with re- ference rather to the substance than to the form of action...........\".Applying this test we consider that the essential bundle of facts on which the plaintiffs based their title and their right to relief were identical in the two suits. The property sought to be recovered in the two suits was the same. The title of the persons from whom the plaintiffs claimed title by purchase, was based on the same facts viz., the position of Md. Ismail quoad his co-heirs and the beneficial interests of the latter not being affected or involved in the mortgages, the mortgage-decree and the sale in execution thereof. No doubt, the plaintiff set up his purchases as the source of his title to sue, but if as we have held the bar under 0. IX. r. 9 applies equally to the plaintiff in the first suit and those claiming under him, the allegations regarding the transmission of title to the plaintiffs in the present suit ceases to be material. The only new allegation was about the plaintiffs getting into possession by virtue of purchase and their dispossession.Their addition, however, does not wipe out the identity otherwise of the cause of action. It would, of course, have made a difference if, without reference to the antecedent want of fun title in Ismail which was common to the case set up in the two plaints in Suit 58 of 1931 and Suit 18 of 1943, the plaintiffs could, on the strength of the possession and dispossession or the possessory title that they alleged, have obtained any relief. It is, however, admitted that without alleging and proving want of full title in Md. Ismail the plaintiffs could be granted no relief in their present suit.(1) (1873) 12 Beng. L.R 304,315.134- 59S.C--14 210 The question is whether the further allegations about possession in October, 1934 have really destroyed the basic and substantial identity of the causes of action in the two suits. This can be answered only in the negative. The learned Judges of the High Court therefore correctly held that the suit was substantially barred by O. IX. r. 9.It now remains to consider the claim of the plaintiffs to the 2 annas 13 odd gundas share of Ashfaq. In paragraph 52 of their plaint the plaintiffs stated that by a registered sale-deed executed on April 18, 1931 Ashfaq, the son of Azam Ali sold the entire interest which he possessed in the Azamabad Tea Estate to Pir Baksh in pursuance of a Bainama dated April 7, 1930 and put him in possession, and in the succeeding paragraph they set out their purchases of this share by a Kabala dated September 2, 1943. In the joint written statement filed on behalf of the defendants 1 and 2 these allegations were controverted. The execution of the sale-deed in favour of Pir Baksh was denied and it was further stated that even if the sale-deed were proved to have been executed it was a sham and nominal transaction and therefore inoperative to pass title. Though no specific issue in relation to this sale to Pir Baksh was raised, there was a general issue (Issue No. 8) which related to the plaintiff's acquiring title to the Tea Estate. Ile sale deed by Ashfaq was filed and marked as Ex. 12(i) and the sale in favour of the plaintiffs by Pir Baksh as Ex. 12(c).The effect however of this sale to Pir Baksh on the rights of the plaintiffs to relief does not appear to have been raised before the learned trial Judge. It may be pointed out that the learned trial Judge held that Ismail was the full owner of the property under the lease granted in 1928, by reason of the provisions of the Crown Grants Act and even if this were not so, he held that his co-heirs had consented to put him forward as the ostensible owner of the property with the result that they were' estopped from impeaching the mortgage and the sale of the property in execution of the mortgage decree. It is therefore possible that because of the view which the learned trial Judge was inclined to take of the title of Md. Ismail, the plaintiffs did not seriously put forward their rights under their purchase from Pir Baksh, because if the learned trial Judge was right, the sale by Ashfaq to Pir Baksh even if real 211 would not have helped the plaintiffs to obtain any relief.In this connection it may be pointed that the plaintiffs claim to the 8 pies share which was allowed in their favour by the High Court, was not pressed in the trial court.Even in the High Court, however, the point arising from the sale by Ashfaq to Pir Baksh does not seem to have been pressed.We shall presently advert to and examine the submissions made to us by Mr. Sen as regards the merits of this claim to the share of Ashfaq, but before doing so we must refer to a point raised by Mr. Sen which necessitated a prolonged adjournment of the appeal after the main arguments were heard. After pointing out that the plaintiffs did not agitate or press before the courts below any special right based on the purchase of Ashfaq's share through Pir Baksh, he submitted that this might possibly have been because the property covered by the sale deed Ex. 12 (i) did not comprise Touza No. 911--the Azamabad Tea Estate. There was scope for this submission because in the record as printed for the use of this Court, the Schedule annexed to the sale deed Ex. 12(i) was not printed but only the portion containing the description of the parties and the words of conveyance, with the result that Mr. Desai was unable to make out whether as a fact Ashfaq's interest in the suit property was sold under Ex. 12(i). To make matters worse the Schedule to the sale deed of 1943 executed by Pir Baksh was also not translated and printed in the record prepared for the appeal. In view, however, of the categorical statement in the plaint as regards the indentity of the property conveyed under Ex. 12(i) with Ashfaq's share in the Azamabad Tea Estate, we considered that the appellant's submission could not be rejected as frivolous. We therefore acceded to the request of Mr. Desai and called foe the original of Ex. 12(i) from the High Court so that counsel might make submissions to us as regards the identity of the property conveyed. The document was accordingly obtained 'and translated for the use of the Court and when the appeal was again placed before us Mr. Sen admitted that the property conveyed by Ex. 12(i) was Ashfaq's 2 as. 13 gundas odd interest in Touza No. 911.212 Coming now to the merits of the plaintiff's claim, it is common ground that if the sale by Ashfaq were real and intended to pass title to Pir Baksh, the plaintiffs would be entitled to a decree for a declaration that in addition to the 8 pies share granted to them by the High Court, they would be entitled to a further 2 as. 13 gundas share of Ashfaq in the plaint A Schedule property. Mr. Sen's submission, however, was that we should not entertain or give effect to this claim, because several circumstances throw grave suspicion on the reality of the transaction, and that in any event the claim could not be accepted without careful scrutiny of the facts.Having regard to the definite case raised in the pleadings, we are not disposed to reject the claim merely because the same was not pressed in the courts below. Besides we cannot ignore the circumstance that the sale deeds Ex. 12(i) and 12(c) on which the claim was based were filed in the trial court, and Pir Baksh was examined to formally prove these deeds as the 31st witness for the plaintiff. Moreover, even though as regards certain other transfers, the trial Judge recorded findings that they were nominal, there was no such finding as regards the sale by Ashfaq. In view of these features, we have decided not to reject the claim of the plaintiffs based on this ground.There are, however, certain features which throw some suspicion on the reality of the transaction which Mr. Sen pressed before us which have led us to desist from ourselves passing a decree for this additional share in their favour.The circumstances to which Mr. Sen drew our attention were these; (i) though Ashfaq executed the sale deed Ex. 12(i) on April 18, 1931, he figured as the first plaintiff in Suit 58 of 1931 which was filed on 28th November, 1931, without adverting to the sale, a piece of conduct certainly not consistent with the sale being real and intended to pass title; (2) though in the plaint the necessary averments were made regarding their obtaining the share of Ashfaq through Pir Baksh, the claim under this head was not pressed before the trial court; (3) when the plaintiffs preferred an appeal to the High Court from the total dismissal of the suit, they did not raise any specific ground touching their right to this share, nor were any argument 213 addressed to the High Court on this point; and (4) there had been no mutation in the revenue records when this sale was effected and Pir Baksh who was examined as a witness admitted this fact. These circumstances are certainly capable of explanation, but they show that the claim of the plaintiffs cannot be accepted by us straightaway and a decree passed in their favour.In these circumstances, we consider that the proper order to pass would be to remit the matter to the trial Court for recording a finding as regards the reality of the sale on the evidence already on the record and to pass an appropriate decree in the suit, that is, if the sale under Ex. 12(i) were held to be real, the plaintiffs would be entitled in addition to the 8 pies share decreed to them by the High Court, to a further 2 as 13 gondas odd share belonging to Ashfaq which they obtained under Ex. 12(c) through Pir Baksh, and in the event of the sale not being held to be real to no more than what the High Court has decreed.With this modification, the appeal is dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.LIIofIndia: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback\n",

V. Gupte, Additional Solicitor-General, N. S. Bindra and R. H. Dhebar, for the Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court.A. V. Ranganadham Chetty, A. Vedavalli and A. V. Rangam, for the intervener (W. C. Chopra).January 14, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AYYANGAR J.-The proper construction of Art. 145(1) (a) of the Constitution in the context of a prayer for a declaration that rule 16 of Order IV of the Supreme Court Rules as invalid is the principal point raised in this petition which has been filed by an Advocate who under the Advocates Act, 1961, is entitled to practise in this Court.The petitioner was enrolled in the Madras High Court on November 15, 1955 under the Indian Bar Councils Act, 1926 and was admitted to the rolls of this Court on October 29, 1960 under Order IV of the Supreme Court Rules as they then stood. She states that as an Advocate entitled to practise in this Court, she is entitled as of right not merely to plead but also to act, and that the rules of this Court 231 which prescribe qualifications before she could be permitted to act are therefore invalid. The prayer which she makes by her petition is therefore for a declaration that rule 16(1) of Order IV of the Supreme Court Rules as amended in 1962 which contains this prescription of qualifications be declared ultra vires of this Court and a further declaration that she is entitled to practise as an Advocate on record in this Court without conforming to the requirements now im- posed by the impugned rule.Rule 16 whose validity is challenged runs:\"16. No Advocate shall be qualified to be registered as an Advocate on Record unless he- (1) has undergone training for one year with an Advocate on Record approved by the Court, and has thereafter passed such tests as may be held by the Court for Advocates who apply to be registered as Advocates on Record, particulars whereof shall be notified in the Gazette of India from time to time; provided however, that an Attorney shall be exempted from such training and test;(2) has an office in Delhi within a radius of 10 miles from the Court House and gives an undertaking to employ, within one month of his being registered as Advocate on Record. a registered clerk; and (3) pays a registration fee of Rs. 25\".It might be mentioned that under the Rules though every Advocate whose name is maintained in the common roll of Advocates prepared under s. 20 of the Advocates' Act, is entitled to plead, only those Advocates who are registered as \"Advocates on record\" are entitled to act as well, for rule 17 of Order provides :\"17. An Advocate on Record shall be entitled to act as well as plead for any party in a proceeding on his filing in the proceeding a memorandum of appearance accompanied by a Vakalat- 232 nama duly executed by the party in the pres- cribed form.No Advocate other than an Advocate on Record shall be entitled to file an appearance or act for a party in the Court.\" The contention urged by the petitioner who argued her case in person and presented the points arising with ability and moderation, is that under s. 58(3) of the Advocates Act which reads \"58. (3) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, every person who, immediately before the 1st day of December, 1961, was an advocate on the roll of any High Court under the Indian Bar Councils Act, 1926 or who has been enrolled as an advocate under this Act shall, until Chapter IV comes into force, be entitled as of right to practise in the Supreme Court, subject to the rules made by the Supreme Court in this behalf\" she is entitled \"as of right to practise\" in this Court. and she claims that the \"right to practise\" would include not merely the-right to plead, but also the right to act. She is right so far. Her further submission is as regards the scope and content of the rules which might lawfully be made by this Court. Undoubtedly, if there were no rules made by the Supreme Court or if, as the petitioner contends, the rules now made-Order IV Rules 16 and 17-are invalid the petitioner would be entitled not merely to plead as she is now entitled to, but also to act which latter she is now prevented by rule 17 unless she has complied with the requirements of rule 16.The question then for consideration is whether the impugned rules are valid. This depends upon the proper construction of Art. 145(1)(a) by virtue of which the impugned rule has been framed, which reads:\"145. (1) Subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, the Supreme Court may from time to time, with the approval of the President, 233 make rules for regulating generally the practice and procedure of the Court including- (a) rules as to the persons practising before the court;\" As regards this Article there are two matters to which attention might be directed. By the opening words of the Article the rules made by this Court are subject to the provision of any law made by Parliament, so that if there is any provision in a law made by Parliament by which either the right to make the rule is restricted or which contains provisions contrary to the rules, it is beyond dispute that the law made by Parliament would prevail. It is the submission of the petitioner that s. 58(3) quoted earlier, is such a law made by Parliament and that the absolute right. granted to persons in the position of the petitioner to \"practise as of right\" cannot be controlled by rules made by this Court. In this connection our attention was invited to the decision of this Court in Aswini Kumar Ghosh and Anr.v. Arabinda Bose and Anr(1). Here this Court explained what the expression right to practise' meant. It was laid down that these words which occurred in the Supreme Court Advocates (Practise in High Court Act, 1951 whose s. 2 enacted \"Every Advocate of the Supreme Court shall be entitled as of right to practise in any High Court whether or not he is an Advocate of that High Court\" meant that such an Advocate was entitled not merely to plead but to act as well, and that the enactment prevailed notwithstanding any rule made by the High Courts of Calcutta and Bombay restricting the right to act on the original sides of those courts. The decision, however, does not carry the matter far, because it was based on the inconsistency between \"the right to practise as of right\" conferred by the enactment of 1951 and the saving as regards the rule making power of the High Courts of Bombay and Calcutta to restrict \"the right to act\" on the original side of those courts which was contained in the Bar Councils Act 1926. This Court held that it was a case of an implied repeal of that saving by the later legislation.(1) [1952] INSC 50; [1953] S.C.R. 1 234 Nevertheless the petitioner, as stated earlier, is certainly right in her submission that the words 'right to practise' would in its normal connotation take in, not merely right to plead but the right to act as well and that is why we said that if no rules had been made by the Supreme Court res- tricting the right to act, the petitioner could undoubtedly have a right both to plead as well as to act.But we have already pointed out that under s. 58(3) of the Act, the right conferred on Advocates enrolled under the Bar Councils Act to practise in the Supreme Court is made subject to any rules made by this Court. To reinforce this position there is a saving enacted by s. 52 of the Advocates Act which specifically saves the powers of this Court to make rules under Art. 145. Section 52 reads:- \"52. Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect the power of the Supreme Court to make rules under article 145 of the Constitution- (a) for laying down the conditions subject to which a senior advocate shall be entitled to practise in that Court;(b) for determining the persons who shall be entitled to act in that behalf.\" In view of the saving which is repeated in s. 52 there is no question of the rule restricting the right to act to a certain class of advocates as being contrary to a law made by Parliament. The only question for consideration is whether Art. 145 (1) (a) is sufficient to empower this Court to frame the impugned rules.The argument addressed to us with considerable earnestness was that under the Article the rules to be framed under the items (a) to (j) were all to be framed for regulating the practice and procedure of the Court which she urged indi- cated the underlying purpose with which the rule making power was vested in the Court. Secondly she urged that if head (a) -in sub-Article (1) reading \"rules as to the persons practising before the Court\", were treated as an independent -subject, entirely, divorced from the context of the opening words \"practice and procedure of the Court\", even then the 235 power to make the rule was confined to the regulation of the conduct of the persons practising i.e. entitled under the law to practising and so practising before the Court.Though a number of decisions were cited to us as to what was meant by 'practise and procedure of the Court' we do not think it useful or necessary to refer to them. They would have been relevant and might require serious consideration if the entire Power to make the rule was to depend merely on the words \"regulating the practice and procedure of the Court\" but the Article specifically makes provision enabling rules to be made \"as to persons practising before the Court.\" We are inclined to read item (a) as an independent head of rule making power and not as merely a part of a power to make rules for \"regulating the practice and procedure of the Court.\" The word 'including' which precedes the enumeration of the items (a) to (i) as well as the subject matter of item (a), stamp it as an independent head of power.We do not, therefore, propose to deal with what exactly would have been the content of a \"regulation of practice and proceedure.\" but shall proceed to consider the meaning of the words \"Rules as to the persons practising before the Court\" because if the rules now impugned could be justified as within this power their validity cannot be impeached.Now as regards these words in item (a) the submission of the petitioner was two-fold : Firstly, she contrasted these words with entry 77 in the Union List in Sch. VII the last portion of which reads:\"Persons entitled to practise before the Supreme Court.\" Relying on the contrast -between the two expressions \"per- sons practising\" and \"persons entitled to practise\" the sub- mission was that the words \"persons practising before the Court\" was narrower and gave this Court power to frame rules only to determine the manner in which persons who had obtained a right to practise under a law made by Parliament by virtue of its power under entry 77 could exercise 236 that right. In this connection she drew a distinction bet- ween 'being entitled to practise' which would include deter- mining or prescribing the qualifications that a person should possess before becoming entitled to practise, which she urged was the subject matter of entry 77, and a rule as to \"a person practising before a court\" which was the second stage after the right to practice had been obtained by Parliamentary legislation. In other words, the submission was that by a rule made under Art. 145(1)(a) this Court could neither entitle a person to practise nor impose qualifications as to the right to practise-these being matters entirely within entry 77 and therefore exclusively for parliamentary legislation.We feel unable to accept this argument. We do not agree that the words \"persons practising before the Court\" is narrower than the words \"persons entitled to practise before the Court\". The learned Additional Solicitor-General was well-founded in his submission that if, for instance, there was no law made by Parliament entitling any person to practise before this Court, the construction suggested by the applicant would mean that this Court could not make a rule prescribing qualifications for persons to practise in this Court. In this connection it is interesting to notice that the words used in Art. 145(1)(a) have been taken substantially from s. 214(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935. That section ran, to quote the material words:\"The Federal Court may from time to time, with the approval of the Governor-General in his discretion make rules of Court for regulating generally the practice and procedure of the Court including rules as to the persons practising before the Court........The Government of India Act, 1935 did not in its legislative lists have a provision like as we have in entry 77 of List I (vide entry 53 of List I). The Federal Court immediately on its formation made rules and under Order IV of those rules provision was made prescribing qualifications for the 237 enrolment as Advocates of the Federal Court. Advocates entitled to practise in the High Courts with a standing of 5 years on the rolls of High Court and who satisfied certain requisite conditions were entitled to be enrolled as Advo- cates, while for enrolment as Senior Advocates a standing of 10 years as an Advocate of a High Court Bar was prescribed.We are pointing this out only for the purpose of showing that the words \"as to the persons practising before the Court\" were then used in a comprehensive sense so as to include a rule not merely as to the manner of practice but also of the right to practise or the entitlement to practice. Those words which are repeated in Art. 145(1)(a) have still the same content. We ought to add that there is no anomaly involved in the construction that this Court can by its rules make provision prescribing qualifications entitling persons to practise before it, and that Parliament can do likewise. There is no question of a conflict between the legislative power of Parliament and the rule-making power of this Court, because by reason of the opening words of Art. 145, any rule made by this Court would have operation only subject to laws made by Parliament on the subject of the entitlement to practise. We are, therefore, clearly of the opinion that on the express terms of Art.145(1)(a) the impugned rules 16 and 17 are valid and within the rule-making power.The learned Additional-Solicitor made a further submission that the rule could be justified under the inherent powers of the Court and relied for this purpose on the decision of this Court in re: Sant Ram [1960] INSC 68; [1960] 3 S.C.R. 499 where at pages 504, 505 the inherent powers of this Court have been referred to. In the view we take about the construction of Art. 145(1)(a) we do not think it necessary to rest our decision on the inherent powers of this Court to frame a rule of this sort.The petition, therefore, fails and is rejected.Petition dismissed.LIIofIndia: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback\n",

      "The respondent challenged the election of the appellant, inter alia, on the ground that there had been improper reception, refusal and rejection of votes at the time of counting and that on a true count he would have received a majority of valid votes and that he was entitled to be declared duly elected. He claimed that by inspection of the ballot papers he would be able to establish his case on the aforesaid allegations and that the Tribunal was bound to grant an order for inspection, because he had tendered the sealed boxes of ballot papers in evidence, and on that account all the ballot papers were part of the record. The Tribunal in its order stated that nothing was brought to its notice which would justify granting an order for inspection.It further observed: \"If in future from the facts that may be brought to the notice of the Tribunal, it appears that in the interests of justice inspection should be allowed, necessary orders allowing an inspection could always be passed\". Thereupon, another application was submitted by the respondent asking for inspection but no additional materials were placed before the Tribunal and no oral evidence was led at the trial. The Tribunal rejected the application for inspection. On appeal, the High Court held that ballot papers had actually been called for from the Returning Officer and were before the Tribunal, and there was nothing in the Code of Civil Procedure which prevented the Tribunal from allowing inspection of the ballot papers in the custody of the Court. The Tribunal had therefore rejected the application for inspection without any adequate reasons.The sole question for determination was whether the Election Tribunal erred in declining to grant an order for inspection of the ballot papers which had been, pursuant to an order in that behalf, lodged before the Tribunal in sealed boxes by the Returning Officer. \n",

Gopali, 22 E.L.R. 288, distinguished.CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1064 of 1963.Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated July 23, 1963, of the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench) in First Civil Appeal No. 11 of 1963.N. C. Chatterjee and J. P. Goyal, for the appellant.S. P. Sinha and S. Shaukat Hussain, for respondent No. 1.January 17, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH J.-At the general elections held in February 1962, five candidates contested the election to the House of the People from the Barabanki single-member constituency. The appellant Ram Sewak Yadav-who will be referred to as Yadav- was at the counting of votes found to have secured the highest number of votes and he was declared elected.Hussain Kamil Kidwai-hereinafter called Kidwai-who was one of the candidates at the election submitted a petition on April 6, 1962, to the Election Commission for an order declaring the election of Yadav void and for an order that he (Kidwai) be declared duly elected. The Election Tribunal, Lucknow, to which the petition was referred for trial dismissed the petition. In appeal to the High Court of Allahabad the order passed by the Election 240 Tribunal was reversed and the proceedings were remanded for trial with a direction, among others, that the Tribunal do give reasonable opportunity to both the parties to inspect the ballot papers and other connected papers. With special leave, Yadav has appealed against the order of the High Court.The principal grounds set up by Kidwai in support of his petition were- (1) that there had been improper reception, refusal and rejection of votes at the time of counting, and in consequence thereof the election was materially affected;(2) that there were discrepancies between the total number of votes mentioned in Form 16 and Form 20;(3) that the tendered votes were wrongly rejected by the returning officer and on that account the election was materially affected;(4) that at the polling station No. 29, Majgawan in Bhitauli Unit and Kursi polling station in Kursi Assembly Unit, the polling officers did not give ballot papers to the voters;(5) that the counting of votes of Bhitauli Assembly Unit continued till 8-30 p.m. in insufficient light notwithstanding the protest lodged by the petitioner; and (6) that on a true count he (Kidwai) would have received a majority of valid votes and that he was entitled to be declared duly elected.These allegations were denied by Yadav.At the trial before the Tribunal the parties led no oral evidence. In respect of the pleas (3), (4) and (5) the burden of proof lay upon Kidwai and as no evidence was led to .-substantiate the same, those pleas failed. Again in the view of the Tribunal, Kidwai could discharge the burden of proof which lay upon him to establish that there were discrepancies ,between the original and the certified copies of Forms Nos 241 16 & 20, and as the original forms were not called for by Kidwai, his second ground must also fail. Kidwai claimed that he would be able to establish his case on pleas (1) & (6) from the ballot papers, and submitted that an order for inspection of the ballot papers be made and that he be per- mitted to show from the ballot papers that the Returning Officer had improperly received, refused or rejected the votes, and that on a true count he would get the largest number of valid votes. The Tribunal rejected the applica- tion for inspection holding that ballot papers may be allowed to be inspected only if it is necessary in the interest of justice and to support an order for inspection facts must be brought to its notice making out a prima facie case disclosing that errors were committed in the reception, refusal or rejection of votes at the time of counting, and unless a prima facie case was made out the Tribunal would be justified in declining to make an order for inspection. The High Court however held that ballot papers had actually been called for from the Returning Officer and were before the Tribunal, that there was nothing in the Code of Civil Procedure which prevented the Tribunal from allowing inspection of the ballot papers in the custody of the Court, and that the Tribunal had rejected the application for inspection without any adequate reasons for so doing.The only question which falls to be determined in this appeal is whether the Election Tribunal erred in declining to grant an order for inspection of the ballot papers which had been, pursuant to its order in that behalf, lodged before it in sealed boxes by the Returning Officer. In considering this question the material provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the rules framed thereunder may first be noticed. Section 80 of the Act provides that no election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of Part VI. Section 83(1) states what the election petition shall contain. It states:\"Art election petition- (a) shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies;159 S.C-16 242 (b) shall set forth full particulars of any corrupt practice that the petitioner alleges, including as full a statement as posssible of the names of the parties alleged to have committed such corrupt practice and the date and place of the commission of each such practice; and (c) shall be signed by the petitioner and verified in the manner laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, for the verification of pleadings:The rest of the section is not material.Section 90(1) prescribes the procedure to be followed by the Tribunal. It states:\"Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any rules made thereunder, every election petition shall be tried by the Tribunal, as nearly as may be, in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, to the trial of suits: \" Section 92 enumerates the powers which a Tribunal trying an election petition may exercise and the powers so enumerated are the powers which a Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, when trying a suit, may exercise in respect of discovery and inspection, enforcing attendance of witnesses, compelling production of documents, receiving evidence taken on affidavits and issuing commissions for the examination of witnesses. Rules have been framed under the Act relating to production and inspection of election papers. By rule 93 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, it is provided that:\"(1) While in the custody of the returning officer- (a) the packets of unused ballot papers;(b) the packets of used ballot papers whether valid, tendered or rejected;(c) the packets of the marked copy of the electoral roll or, as the case may be, the list maintained under sub-section (1) or sub- section (2) of section 152; and 243 (d) the packets of the declarations by electors and the attestation of their signatures;shall not be opened and their contents shall not be inspected by, or produced before, any person or authority except under the order of a competent court or tribunal.(2) All other papers relating to the election shall be open to public inspection subject to such fee, if any, as the Election Commission may direct.(3) Copies of the returns by the returning officer forwarded under rule 64 or as the case may be. under sub-rule (3) of rule 84 shall be furnished by the chief electoral officer of the State concerned on payment of a fee of two rupees for each such copy.\" The rule makes a clear distinction between ballot papers and other election papers: ballot papers may be inspected only under the order of a competent court or tribunal, but other documents are, subject to certain conditions, open to public inspection.In this case, on an oral request made by Kidwai all the ballot papers in sealed boxes were lodged with the Election Tribunal. Kidwai claimed in the first instance that the Tribunal was bound to grant an order for inspection, because he had tendered the sealed boxes of ballot papers in evidence, and on that account all the ballot papers were part of the record. The Tribunal rightly rejected this plea, to by the mere production of the sealed boxes pursuant to its order the ballot papers did not become part of the record and they were not liable to be inspected unless the Tribunal was satisfied that such inspection was in the circumstances of the case necessary in the interests of justice.An election petition must contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies in support of his case. If such material facts are set out the Tribunal has undoubtedly the power to direct discovery and inspection of documents with which a civil court is invest- 244 ed under the Code of Civil Procedure when trying a suit.But the power which the civil court may exercise in the trial of suits is confined to the narrow limits of 0. II, Code of Civil Procedure. Inspection of documents under 0.II, Code of Civil Procedure may be ordered under rule 15, of documents which are referred to in the pleadings or particulars as disclosed in the affidavit of documents of the other party, and under rule 18(2) of other documents in the possession or power of the other party. The Returning Officer is not a party to an election petition, and an order for production of the ballot papers cannot be made under 0.11 Code of Civil Procedure. But the Election Tribunal is not on that account without authority in respect of the ballot papers. In a proper case where the interests of justice demand it. the Tribunal may call upon the Returning Officer to produce the ballot papers and may permit inspection by the parties before it of the ballot papers.That power is clearly implicit in ss. 100(1)(d)(iii), 101, 102 and rule 93 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.This power to order inspection of the ballot papers which is apart from 0.11 Code of Civil Procedure may be exercised, subject to the statutory restrictions about the secrecy of the ballot paper prescribed by ss. 94 and 128(1).An order for inspection may not be granted as a matter of course: having regard to the insistence upon the secrecy of the ballot papers, the Court would be justified in granting an order for inspection provided two conditions are ful- filled:(i) that the petition for setting aside an election con- tains an adequate statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies in support of his case; and (ii) the Tribunal is prima facie satisfied that in order to decide the dispute and to do complete justice between the parties inspection of the ballot papers is necessary, But an order for inspection of ballot papers cannot be granted to support vague pleas made in the petition not supported by material facts or to fish out evidence to support such pleas. The case of the petitioner must be set out with pre- 245 cision supported by averments of material facts. To estab- lish a case so pleaded an order for inspection may undoubt- edly, if the interests of justice require, be granted. But a mere allegation that the petitioner suspects or believes that there has been an improper reception, refusal or rejection of votes will not be sufficient to support an order for inspection.It must be remembered that the rules framed under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, set up an elaborate machinery relating to the stage of counting of votes by the Returning Officer, and provide ample opportunity to the can- didate who has contested the election or his agents to remain present and to keep an eye on any improper action which may be taken by the Returning Officer. Rule 53 provides for the admission of only certain classes of persons to the place fixed for counting and amongst such persons are expressly included candidates, their election agents and counting agents, who may watch the counting subject to the directions which the returning officer may give. Rule 55 deals with the procedure for scrutiny and opening of ballot boxes. The Returning Officer has to satisfy himself that \"none of the ballot boxes has in fact been tampered with\" and before any ballot box is opened at the counting table, the counting agents present at that table are allowed to inspect the seal affixed thereon and to satisfy themselves that it is intact. If the Returning Officer is satisfied that any ballot box has in fact been tampered with, he is prohibited from counting the ballot papers contained in that box and he has to follow the procedure prescribed in that behalf in s. 58. Clause (1) of rule 56 provides for the scrutiny and rejection of ballot papers. Clause (2) sets out detailed provisions relating to, cases in which the Returning Officer shall reject a ballot paper By cl. (3) it is provided that before rejecting any ballot paper under sub-rule (2), the returning officer shall allow each counting agent present a reasonable opportunity to inspect such ballot papers. The Returning Officer has then to record on every ballot paper which he rejects the grounds of rejection. All the rejected ballot papers are required to be put in one bundle. Rule 57 deals with the counting of votes. Each ballot paper which is not rejected is counted 246 as one valid vote. The Returning Officer has to make the entries in a result sheet in Form 20 after counting of the ballot papers contained in all the ballot boxes used at the polling stations. Clause (3) of rule 57 enacts an elaborate set of rules about the entries to be made in respect of the counting and scrutiny of the ballot papers. By rule 60 counting has to be continuous, and rule 63(1) provides that after the completion of the counting, the Returning Officer shall record in the result sheet in Form 20 the total number of votes polled by each candidate and announce the result.By cl. (2) of rule 63 it is provided that after such announcement is made, a candidate or his election agent may apply in writing to the Returning Officer for' a recount of all or any of the ballot papers already counted stating the grounds on which he demands such recount. The Returning Officer must decide the application and record his reasons in support of his decision and he may allow the application in whole or in part or may reject it if it appears to him to be frivolous or unreasonable. After the total number of votes polled by each candidate has been announced, the Returning Officer must complete and sign the result sheet in Form 20 and after such form is completed no application for recount may be entertained. Under rule 64 the declaration of the result of the election is made by declaring elected a candidate who has secured the largest number of valid votes, and the Returning Officer is required to complete and certify the return of election.There can therefore be no doubt that at every stage in the process of scrutiny and counting of votes the candidate or his agents have an opportunity of remaining present at the counting of votes, watching the proceedings of the Returning Officer, inspecting any rejected votes, and to demand a are- count. Therefore a candidate who seeks to challenge an election on the ground that there has been improper reception, refusal or rejection of votes at the time of counting, has ample opportunity of acquainting himself with the manner in which the ballot boxes were scrutinized and opened, and the votes were counted. He has also opportunity of inspecting rejected ballot papers, and of demanding a re- count. It is in the light of the provisions of s. 83(1) which require a concise statement of material facts 247 on which the petitioner relies and to the opportunity which a defeated candidate had at the time of counting, of watching and of claiming a recount that the application for inspection must be considered.In the petition filed by Kidwai the material allegations in support of the claim that there had been improper reception, refusal or rejection of votes were contained in paragraphs 6(H), 6(K) and 12. In paragraph 6(H) it was averred that numerous ballot papers cast in favour of the petitioner were wrongly included in the \"bundles of the respondents.\" In paragraph 6(K) it was averred that due to \"a deficiency in the supply of sealing ink, marks on some ballot papers, though not quite clear, yet the marks clearly indicating the intention of the voters, were wrongly rejected as invalid by the returning officer.\" In paragraph 12 it was averred that \"the petitioner is confident that if the votes actually cast in favour of the petitioner are counted as votes of the petitioner and if the improperly accepted votes which have been counted in favour of other respondents are taken out, and if the ballot papers are correctly sorted, counted and bundled. the respondent No. 1 will be found to have polled less votes as compared to . . . petitioner. The petitioner further submits that the result of the Election has been materially affected by the improper acceptance and refusal of votes and by the incorrect sorting, counting and bundling of ballot papers.\" These averments in the petition for setting aside the election on the ground of improper acceptance or rejection of votes were vague, and did not comply with the statutory requirements of s. 83(1)(a).Paragraph 12 is deficient in the recital of material facts which must be deemed to be within the knowledge of the petitioner, and merely asserts that if the votes actually cast in favour of the petitioner are counted, the total number of valid votes found in his favour would exceed the number of votes received by Yadav. Having regard to this infirmity the Tribunal was justified in declining to make an order for inspection of the ballot papers unless a prima facie case was made out in support of the claim. The Tribunal has undoubtedly to exercise its discretion if it appears to be in the interests of justice, but the discretion has manifestly to be exercised having regard to the nature of the allegations made. The Tribunal would be Justified ir 248 refusing an order where inspection is claimed with a view to fish out materials in support of a vague plea in the case set out in the petition. The Tribunal was conscious of the true principle: it stated in its order dated August 25, 1962, that nothing was brought to its notice which would justify granting an order for inspection prayed for by the petitioner at that stage. The Tribunal further observed:\"If in future from facts that may be brought to the notice of the Tribunal, it appears that in the interests of justice inspection should be allowed, necessary orders allowing an inspection could always be passed\".Relying upon these observations another application was submitted by Kidwai asking for inspection but no additional materials were placed before the Tribunal. As we have already observed Kidwai led no real evidence at the trial.In his second application for inspection he merely averred that \"the petitioner was almost sure\" that on inspection and scrutiny of ballot papers, the allegations contained in the various paragraphs would be proved. The allegation of Kidwai that he was satisfied that on inspection and scrutiny of ballot papers he would be able to demonstrate that there had been wrong counting on account of improper reception, refusal or rejection of votes was wholly insufficient to justify a claim for inspection. He had to place before the Tribunal evidence prima facie indicating that an order for inspection was necessary in the interests of justice, which he failed to do.Reliance was placed before this Court and the High Court upon the decision of this Court in Bhim Sen v. Gopali and others(1) in support of the plea that mere absence of parti- culars will not furnish a ground for declining to grant ins- pection and that a defeated candidate is entitled to establish his case that void votes had been counted and included in the votes of the successful candidate from the evidence collected from inspection of the ballot papers. In Bhim Sen's case(1) a petition was filed for setting aside an election of a candidate in a reserved seat in a double member constituency. The principal ground in support of the petition (1) 22 E.L.R. 288.249 was that it was incumbent upon the Returning Officer to go into each case of double voting in order to reject one of the two votes cast in contravention of s. 63(1) of the Representation of the People Act, and that the Returning Officer having failed to discharge his duty to reject ballot papers cast in contravention of s. 63 the petitioner believed that the successful candidate \"could receive many void votes.\" The ballot boxes were opened and it was found that 37 void votes were counted in favour of the successful candidate and in view of the disclosure made by the inspection of the ballot papers the petitioner applied for leave to amend the petition by adding a specific averment that 37 void votes had in fact been counted in favour of the successful candidate and that the words \"alleges\" and \"did\" be substituted respectively for the words \"believes\" and \"could\". Along with the petition for leave to amend he filed a list giving the particulars of the void votes. This application was allowed by the Tribunal but the order was reversed by the High Court on the ground that the Tribunal had erred in allowing the amendment. In appeal to this Court it was held that in a case like the one before the Court, definite particulars about the number and' nature of the void votes that had been counted could only be supplied after inspection of the ballot papers, and the election petition as originally presented must therefore be regarded as having furnished the material particulars, and the amendment petition must be treated merely as an application for clarification of the pleadings. We do not think that Bhim Sen's case(1) lays down any general principle that a party is entitled without making allegations of material facts in support of his plea to set aside an election to claim an order for inspection of the ballot papers and seek to supply the lacuna in his petition by showing that if all the votes are scrutinized again by the Tribunal it may appear that there had been improper reception, refusal or rejection of votes at the time of counting. To support his claim for setting aside the election the petitioner has to make precise, allegations of material facts which having regard to the elaborate rules are or must be deemed to be within his knowledge. The nature of the allegations must of course depend' upon the facts of each case. But if material facts are not 22 E.L.R.288.250 stated, he cannot be permitted to make out a case by fishing out the evidence from an inspection of the ballot papers.In Bhim Sen's case(1) the Court was primarily concerned with the question whether amendment of the petition to set aside an election should be granted. It was alleged by the defeated candidate that there had been contravention of the provisions of s. 63 (1 ) of the Act by the Returning Officer and the election was materially affected on that account.The applicant had stated that he believed that the respondents had received many votes which were void. When the ballot box was opened it was found that among the votes credited to the successful candidate were 37 votes which were void. Thereafter the applicant applied to substitute the words \" alleges\" for \"believes\" and \"did\" for \"could\".In that case the Court was not concerned to decide whether the order for inspection was properly made: the propriety of the order granting inspection does not appear to have ever been questioned. The principal question raised in the appeal was whether the amendment of the petition should, in the circumstances, be granted and the observation of the Court that \"definite particulars about the number and nature of the void votes that had been counted could only be supplied after inspection of the ballot papers\" was not intended to be a general statement of the law that whenever an allegation is made in a petition to set aside an election that void votes have been included in the counting of votes received by a successful candidate, definite particulars with regard to the said void votes may only be supplied after the ballot papers are inspected, and that a defeated candidate may claim inspection of the ballot papers without making any specific allegations of material facts and without disclosing a prima facie case in support of the claim made.In our view the High Court was in error in interfering with the exercise of discretion by the Election Tribunal which proceeded upon sound principles. The appeal therefore is allowed and the order of the High Court is set aside. The order of the Tribunal is restored with costs in this Court and the High Court.Appeal allowed.(1) 22 E.L.R. 288LIIofIndia: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback\n",

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA J.-These 31 appeals by the State of Madhya Pradesh are against the orders made by the High Court' of Madhya Pradesh in 31 applications under Art. 226 of the Constitution by dealers in tobacco. All these petitioners carried on business in Madhya Bharat which later became part of the State of Madhya Pradesh. They were assessed to sales tax on their sales of tobacco in accordance with the notification issued by the State Government in exercise of powers under s. 5 of the State Sales Tax Act and large amounts were collected by the Madhya Bharat Government and later by the Madhya Pradesh Government. The petitioners contended that the taxing provisions under which the tax was assessed and collected from them was unconstitutional as it infringed Art. 301 of the Constitution and did not come within the special provision of Art. 304(a). Accordingly, they prayed for appropriate writs or orders for refund of all the taxes that has been collected from them. In resisting these applications the Madhya Pradesh Government contended, first, that the Wing provisions did not offend Art. 301 of the Constitution and that in any case, they satisfied the requirements of Art. 304(a). It was further contended that even if the taxing provision was unconstitutional and the assessment and collection of tax had been without any legal authority the petitioners were not entitled to the order for refund prayed for.264 The High Court was of opinion on a consideration of; the notification under which the tax was assessed that it imposed a tax only on imported tobacco and not on home grown tobacco and so it did not come within the special provisions of Art. 304(a) of the Constitution and consequently the infringement of Art. 301 of the Constitution which resulted from the imposition of a tax on import of goods made the provisions void in law. The prayer for refund was allowed in the applications out of which C.A. Nos. 362-377, C.A.Nos. 861--867 of 1962 and C.A. No. 25 of 1963 have arisen.The prayer was rejected in the remaining applications.In the present appeals the State of Madhya Pradesh challenges the correctness of the High Court's decision that the taxing provision was unconstitutional and void and also the orders for refund made in some of the petitions men- tioned above.The liability to pay tax arose under s.3 of the Madhva Bharat Sales Tax Act. This Act came into force from the 1st day of May 1950. As originally enacted it provided that (a) every dealer who imports goods into Madhya Bharat shall be liable to pay tax on his taxable turnover in respect of sales or supplies of goods effected from the 1st day of May 1950 if his total turnover in the previous year in respect of sales or supplies of goods exceeded Rs 5,000; (b) similarly every manufacturer or processor whose turnover in the previous year exceeded Rs. 5,000 was made liable to pay tax on his taxable turnover in respect of sales or supplies of goods effected from the 1st day of May 1950; (c) every other dealer was made liable to pay tax on his taxable turnover in respect of sales or supplies of goods effected from the 1st day of May 1950, if the total turnover in the previous year exceeded Rs. 12,000. By later amendments the word \"processor\" was deleted from cl. (b) of the section and the meaning of the words \"any other\" in cl. (c) was made clearer by substituting the words \"any goods of a dealer not falling in cl. (a) or cl. (b)\". There was also an amendment in 1950 making it, clear that the taxable turnover on which the tax liability.265 arose was in respect of sales or supplies of goods effected in Madhya Bharat.Section 5 of the Act provides that the tax payable by a dealer shall be at a single point and shall not be less than Rs. 1/9/- per cent or more than 6-1/4 per cent of the taxable turnover, as notified from time to time by the Government by publication in the Official Gazette. This is subject to a proviso that the Government may in respect of a special class of goods charge tax upto 12-1/2% on the taxable turnover. The second sub-section of s. 5 empowers the Government to notify at the time of notifying the tax payable by a dealer, the goods and the point of their sale at which the tax is payable. The legal position therefore is that unless there is a valid notification under s. 5 no tax can be levied. The contention of the petitioners- dealers which has succeeded in the High Court is that the notifications on the strength of which the tax was assessed on them were invalid.The first notification was issued on April 30, 1950. This provided that with effect from the 1st day of May 1950 sales tax shall be collected in respect of goods specified in column 2 of the Schedule that was attached to the notification at the point of sale mentioned in column 3 at the rates mentioned in column 4. The relevant portion of the Schedule ran thus:- -------------------------------------------------------- Sl Name of commodity The point of sale Rate of No. by dealers tax ---------------------------------------------------------9. Tobacco leaves, manufactu- Importer 6-4-0 red tobacco (for eating and Per cent smoking) and tobacco used Sales Tax for Bidi manufacturing.----------------------------------------------------------- This was followed by another notification dated May 22, 1950 under which a lower rate was prescribed for tobacco used for Bidi manufacturers. But the point at which the tax was payable remained unaltered. The rele- 266 vant portion of the Schedule to this notification was in these words:----------------------------------------------------------- Sl. Name of commodity Point of sale Rate per- No. by the dealers cent of tax in M. B.------------------------------------------------------------10. Tobacco leaves and manu- factured tobacco (for eating, Importer 6-4-0 smoking and snuffing)11. Tobacco used for Bidi Importer 1-9-0 manufacturing.------------------------------------------------------------ For a short period, i.e., from the 1st January 1954 to the 21st January 1954 these two notifications remained inoperative in consequence of a notification dated the 24th October, 1953, under which from the 1st January 1954 the point of sale at which the tax was payable was altered to \"on a sale by a dealer direct to a consumer or to a dealer who does not hold a licence or registration certificate under the Sales Tax Act\". This last notification was again superseded by a notification dated the 21st January, 1954 in consequence of which the old position was restored with effect from January 22, 1954. That is, with effect from 22nd January 1954 the point at which the tax was payable, again became a sale by an importer.There can be no doubt that the tax payable at the point of sale by the importer in Madhya Bharat directly impeded the freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by Art. 301 of the Constitution. It is true that the import by itself would not bring in the liability to tax and that if the imported goods were not sold in Madhya Bharat no tax would be -payable. Quite clearly however by far the greater part of the tobacoo leaves, manufactured tobacco (for eating and smoking) and tobacco used for Bidi manufacturing that would be imported into the State would be sold in Madhya Bharat.That a very considerable amount was so sold is clear from the very assessment orders made in these several cases.There can be no doubt therefore 267 that even though it is the sale in Madhya Bharat of the imported goods that creates the liability to tax and not the import by itself, the trade and commerce as between Madhya Bharat and other parts of India is directly impeded by this tax. On the authority of this Court's decision in Atiabari Tea Co., Ltd. v. State of Assam(1) it must therefore be held that the tax contravenes the provisions of Art. 301 of the Constitution. It may be mentioned that the later decision of this Court in Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. v.State of Rajasthan(2) which slightly modified the majority decision in Atiabari Tea Co.'s case does not alter this position. If the tax could have been claimed to be regula- tory or compensatory it would have got the benefit of the latter decision. There is, however, no scope for such a claim (See Firm Mehtab Majid & Co. v. State of Madras) (3).The tax could still be good if even though it contravened the provisions of Art. 301 it came within the saving provi- sions of Art. 304(a) of the Constitution. That Article provides in its cl. (a) that notwithstanding anything in Article 301 or Art. 303 the legislature of a State may by law impose on goods imported from other States any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced. An attempt was made on behalf of the State before the High Court and also before us to construe the notification mentioned above to mean that not only the tobacco imported from other States but also similar goods manufactured or produced in Madhya Bharat were subject to this tax and at the same rate. It was argued that a dealer in these goods who was an importer and so sold goods imported by him into Madhya Bharat would also be selling goods not so imported but manufactured and produced in the State. We are prepared to agree that may well be so. What we are unable to see, however, is that in respect of sales of such other goods this person would be liable to (1) [1960] INSC 123; [1961] 1 S.C.R. 809.(2) [1963] 1 S.C.R. 491.(3) [1962] INSC 330; A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 928.268 any tax under the notification. We are informed that in fact where importers dealt with goods other than imported goods the sales of such other goods were in fact excluded from tax. The learned Advocate-General of Madhya Pradesh who appeared before us in support of these appeals suggested that that was done by the State Sales Tax Authorities on a mistaken interpretation of the law. We do not think so. In our opinion, the only reasonable interpretation of the notification as it stands, viz., that tax on tobacco leaves, manufactured tobacco and tobacco used for Bidi manufacturing would be payable at the point of sale by the importer, is that only the sale of goods which the importer had imported would be liable to tax and not sale of any other goods by him. If the intention had been as suggested by the learned Advocate-General that though the tax is payable at the point of sale by an importer the scale by the same person of goods manufactured or produced in Madhya Bharat would also be liable to tax, the word \"importer\" would not have been used in column 3 but the word \"dealer\" would have been used and the point of sale would have been indicated by some other words as the \"first sale in Madhya Bharat\" or \"the sale to the retailer in Madhya Bharat\" as the rule-making authority chose.The matter becomes even more clear if in column 3 we read for \"importer\" the definition of \"importer of goods\" in s.2(i) of the Act. Reading this we find that the point of sale in Madhya Bharat at which the tax is payable is the sale \"by the dealer who brings or causes to be brought into Madhya Bharat any goods from outside for the purpose of processing, manufacturing or sale\" or \"who purchases goods in Madhya Bharat for the purpose of sale from a dealer who does not ordinarily carry on business in Madhya Bharat.\"When only such a sale is being made the point at which the tax is payable, there is hardly any scope for a serious argument that the notification was intended to make sales by that same dealer of goods manufactured or produced in Madhya Bharat liable to tax.it may not be out of place to notice in this connection the distinction made by s.3 of the Madhya Bharat Sales 269 Tax Act between sales by a dealer who imports goods [cl.(a)] and other dealers [cls. (b) and (c) ]. It is not un- reasonable to think that the Act itself contemplated the sales by an importer of goods as meaning only sales by him of goods imported by him into Madhya Bharat. Apart from this, it has to be noticed that admittedly the notification did not make dealers who dealt only in home grown or home produced tobacco liable to pay the tax. That by itself would be sufficient to bring in the vice of discrimination which is the purpose of Art. 304(a) to prevent.There can, therefore, be no escape from the conclusion that similar goods manufactured or produced in the State of Madhya Bharat have not been subjected to the tax which tobacco leaves, manufactured tobacco and tobacco used for Bidi manufacturing, imported from other States have to pay on sale by the importer. This tax is, therefore, not within the saving provisions of Art. 304(a). As already pointed out it contravenes the provisions of Art. 301 of the Constitution. The tax has therefore been rightly held by the High Court to be invalid. It is clear that the assess- ment of tax under these notifications was thus invalid in law.A portion of the tax thus assessed has been already paid by the petitioners. It cannot now be disputed that this payment was made under a mistake within s.72 of the Indian Contract Act and so the Government to whom the payment has been made by mistake must in law repay it. The question is whether the relief of repayment has to be sought by the tax- payer by an action in a civil court or whether such an order can be made by the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The jurisdiction conferred by Art. 226 is in very wide terms.This Article empowers the High Court to give relief by way of enforcement of fundamental rights and other rights by issuing directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari. According to the petitioners a writ in the nature of mandamus can be appropriately used where money has been paid to the Government by mistake to give relief by commanding repayment 270 of the same. That in a number of cases the High Courts have used the writ of mandamus to enforce such repayment is not disputed. In a recent case in Firm Mehtab Majid & Co., v.The State of Madras(1) this Court made, in a petition under Art. 32, an order for refund of tax illegally collected from the petitioner under Rule 16 of the Madras General Sales Tax (Turnover and Assessment) Rules, 1939. The question whether the Court has this power to order refund was not however raised there. in Sales Tax Officer, Banaras v. Kanhaiya Lal Mukundlal Saraf (2) the appellants disputed the correctness of the High Court's order made in an application under Art.226 of the Constitution directing refund of taxes that had been paid under the U.P. Sales Tax Act on the respondent's forward transactions in silver bullion. After the levy of sales tax on such transactions was held to be ultra vires by the High Court of Allahabad the respondent asked, for refund of the tax paid and when that was refused he applied to the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution for a writ of certiorari for quashing the assessment orders and a writ of mandamus requiring the appellants to refund the amount illegally collected. The order made in this case by the High Court for refund was affirmed by this Court in appeal.In this case also the power of the High Court to order such refund was not challenged either before the High Court or before this Court.We see no reason to think that the High Courts have not got this power. If a right has been infringed-whether a fundamental right or a statutory right-and the aggrieved party comes to the court for enforcement of the right it will not be giving complete relief if the court merely de- clares the existence of such right or the fact that that existing right has been infringed. Where there has been only a threat to infringe the right, an order commanding the Government or other statutory authority not to take the action contemplated would be sufficient. It has been held by this Court that where there has been a threat only and the right has not been actually infringed an application (1) [1962] INSC 330; A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 928.(2) [1959] S.C.R. 1350.271 under Art. 226 would lie and the courts would give necessary relief by making an order in the nature of injunction. It will hardly be reasonable to say that while the court will grant relief by such command in the nature of an order of injunction where the invasion of a right has been merely threatened the court must still refuse, where the right has been actually invaded, to give the consequential relief and content itself with merely a declaration that the right exists and has been invaded or with merely quashing the illegal order made.For the reasons given above, we are clearly of opinion that the High Courts have power for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights and statutory rights to give consequential relief by ordering repayment of money realised by the Government without the authority of law.At the same time we cannot lose sight of the fact that the special remedy provided in Art. 226 is not intended to supersede completely the modes of obtaining relief by an action in a civil court or to deny defences legitimately open in such actions. It has been made clear more than once that the power to give relief under Art. 226 is a discretionary power. This is specially true in the case of power to issue writs in the nature of mandamus. Among the several matters which the High Courts rightly take into consideration in the exercise of that discretion is the delay made by the aggrieved party in seeking this special remedy and what excuse there is for it. Another is the nature of controversy of facts and law that may have to be decided as regards the availability of consequential relief.Thus, where, as in these cases, a person comes to the Court for relief under Art. 226 on the allegation that he has been assessed to tax under a void legislation and having paid it under a mistake is entitled to get it back, the court, if it finds that the assessment was void, being made under a void provision of law, and the payment was made by mistake, is still not bound to exercise its discretion directing repayment. Whether repayment should be ordered in the exercise of this discretion will depend in each case on its own facts and circumstances. It is not easy nor is it desirable to lay down any rule for universal application.It may however be stated 272 as a general rule that if there has been unreasonable delay the court ought not ordinarily to lend its aid to a party by this extraordinary remedy of mandamus. Again, where even if there is no such delay the Government or the statutory authority against whom the consequential relief is prayed for raises a prima facie triable issue as regards the availability of such relief on the merits on grounds like limitation, the Court should ordinarily refuse to issue the writ of mandamus for such payment. In both these kinds of cases it will be sound use of discretion to leave the party to seek his remedy by the ordinary mode of action in a civil court and to refuse to exercise in his favour the extraordinary remedy under Art. 226 of the Constitution.The prayer for refund has been allowed by the High Court in the applications out of which Civil Appeal Nos. 362-377 of 1962 and Civil Appeal Nos. 861--867 of 1962 and Civil Appeal No. 25 of 1963 have arisen. It appears that the tax provisions under which these taxes had been assessed and paid was declared void by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in their decision in Mohammad Siddique v. The State of Madhya Pradesh on January 17, 1956. Later, on August 27, 1957 the Appellate Authority, Sales Tax, in Madhya Bharat made an order relying on the High Court's decision mentioned above. The petitioners claim to have discovered their mistake in making the payments after they came to know of these decisions. it is reasonable to think however that the petitioners must have discovered their mistake as soon as the High Court's decision in the case of Mohammad Siddique v. The State of Madhya Pradesh dated January 17, 1956 became known to them' All these 16 applications were made within less than three years from the 17th January, 1956. The High Court has taken the view that this was not unreasonable delay and in that view has ordered refund. This appears to us to be a sound and judicial exercise of discretion with which this Court ought not to interfere. it may be added that no triable issue as regards the availability of this consequential relief was raised before the High Court nor has any been suggested before us. The order of refund made 273 by the High Court in these cases cannot therefore be dis- turbed- The position in Civil Appeal Nos. 861 to 867 of 1962 is however different. The applications out of which these appeals have arisen were made in September 1959, i.e., about three years and eight months after January 17, 1956 when the High Court of Madhya Pradesh gave their decision declaring the tax provisions in question to be void.It was necessary for the High Court to consider this question of delay before any order for refund was made. It does not appear however that any attention was paid to this question. In making the orders for refund in each of these cases the High Court merely said this:- The present case is governed by Bhailal Bhai's Case (1960 M.P.C. 304). Learned Government Advocate formally raised the question of the remedy open to the petitioner for refund of tax in order to keep the point open in the Supreme Court. We accordingly allow this petition. and issue a writ directing the oppo- nents to refund to the applicant firm the amount of tax collected from it during the above-mentioned period.\" The learned Judges appear to have failed to notice that the delay in these petitions was more than the delay in the petition made in Bhailal Bhai's case out of which Civil Appeal No. 362 of 1962 has arisen. On behalf of the res- pondents-petitioners in these appeals (C.A. Nos. 861 to 867 of 1962) Mr. Andley has argued that the delay in these cases even is not such as would justify refusal of the order for refund. He argued that assuming that the remedy of recovery by action in a civil court stood barred on the date these applications were made that would be no reason to refuse relief under Art. 226 of the Constitution. Learned counsel is right in his submission that the provisions of the Limitation Act do not as such apply to the granting of relief under Art. 226. It appears to us however that the maximum period fixed by the legislature as the time within which the relief by a suit in a civil court must be brought 134--159 S.C. 18 274 may ordinarily be taken to be a reasonable standard by which delay in seeking remedy under Art. 226 can be measured. The Court may consider the delay unreasonable even if it is less than the period of limitation prescribed for a civil action for the remedy. but where the delay is more than this period, it will almost always be proper for the court to hold that it is unreasonable. The period of limitation prescribed for recovery of money paid by mistake under the Limitation Act is three years from the date when the mistake is known. If the mistake was known in these cases on or shortly after January 17, 1956 the delay in making these applications should be considered unreasonable. If, on the other hand, as Mr. Andley seems to argue, the mistake was discovered much later, this would be a controversial fact which cannot conveniently be decided in writ proceedings.In either view of the matter we are of opinion the orders for refund made by the High Court in these seven cases cannot be sustained.The application out of which Civil Appeal No. 25 of 1963 has arisen was also made in 1958, that is, within less than three years from the date of the High Court's decision in Mohammad Siddique v. The State of Madhya Pradesh. The High Court was therefore right in stating in its judgment in this case that it is governed by Bhailal Bhai's case. We see no reason to interfere, with the order for refund made by the High Court in this case.In the result, Civil Appeals Nos. 861 to 867 of 1962 are allowed in part and the orders for refund made in those cases are set aside. The petitioners will be at liberty to seek such relief as they may be entitled to in a civil court, if it be not barred by limitation. There will be no order as to costs in these cases. In two other appeals, viz., Civil Appeal Nos. 28 and 29 of 1962, the respondents have not appeared; so there will be no order as to costs in them. In the other appeals which are dismissed, the appel- lant will pay costs to the respondents.

On these facts the Subordinate Judge held that though the decree holders were entitled to continue previous execution petition, E.P. No. 58/53 was a fresh application as it differed from the original execution petition. On appeal, the High Court held that E.P.

(i) It is true courts have condemned the practice of executing courts using expressions like \"closed\", \"closed for statistical purposes\", struck off\" \"recorded\" etc., and they have also pointed out that there is no provision in the Code of Civil Procedure for making such orders. But assuming that the court has no such power, the passing of such ,in order cannot be tantamount to an order of dismissal, for the intention of the court in making an order \"closed\" for statistical purposes is manifest. It is intended not to finally dispose of the application, but to keep it pending. Whether the order was without jurisdiction or whether it was valid, the legal position would be the same: in one case it would be ignored and in the other it would mean what it stated. In either case the execution petition would be pending on the file of the court. It is not the phraseology used by the Executing Court that really 252 matters, but is is really the substance of the order that is material. Whatever terminology may be used, it is for the Court to ascertain, having regard to the circumstances under which the said order was made, whether the Court intended to finally terminate the execution proceedings. If it did not intend to do so, it must be held that the execution proceedings were pending on the file of the Court. In the present case the subsequent application ie. E.P. No. 58/53 is only an application to continue the previous application i.e. E.P. 13/1939.Biswa Sonan Chunder Gossyamy v.

It would also be a fresh application if it asked for a relief against parties or properties different from those proceeded against in the previous execution petition or asked for a relief substantially different from that asked for in the earlier petition. In the present case the parties are substantially the same in both proceedings, and the decree holders are only proceeding against properties included in the previous application ie. E.P.

Suryaprakasam and Sardar Bahadur, for the appellants. The respondent did not appear.January 20, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO J.-This appeal by certificate raises the question of the applicability of s. 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure, hereinafter called the Code, to the facts of the 253 The relevant facts are as follows: In the year 1928 one Pentapati Venkataramana filed Original Suit No. 3 of 1928 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Visakhapatnam, against 29 defendants for accounts of dissolved partnerships and for the recovery of amounts due to him. On March 30, 1932, the suit was dismissed by the learned Subordinate Judge. On appeal, the High Court of Madras set aside the decree of the Subordinate Judge and passed a joint and several decree in favour of the plaintiffs and defendants 24 to 27 for a sum of Rs. 54,350 with interest thereon. On February 15, 1939, the decree-holders filed an application for execution of the decree, being E.P. No. 13 of 1939, and prayed for realization of the decretal amount by attachment and sale of 31 items of properties described by them in the schedule (Ex. B-4) annexed thereto. The judgmentdebtors filed an objection to the attachment of some of the said items, but that was dismissed. Against the order of dismissal of their objection, the judgment-debtors filed an appeal to the High Court, being C.M.A. No. 26 of 1944. Pending the disposal of the C.M.A., the High Court granted an interim stay of E.P.13 of 1939. Later, the appeal was dismissed on April 26, 1945. After the dismissal of the appeal, when the decree- holders sought to proceed with the execution, the judgment- debtors filed another application being E.A. No. 575 of 1945, alleging that the decree has been adjusted and for recording satisfaction of the decree. But the said application was dismissed on December 12, 1945. The judgment-debtors went up on appeal to the High Court against the said order of dismissal and obtained an interim stay of E.P. 13 of 1939. On September 9, 1947, the High Court allowed the appeal and remanded the case to the trial court for ascertaining whether there was an adjustment of the decree as pleaded by the judgment-debtors. On remand, the executing court again dismissed the application filed by the judgment-debtors. Against the aid order, the judgment- debtors again preferred an appeal, being C.M.A. No. 127 of 1948, in the High Court of Madras and obtained an interim stay of the execution. The interim order was made absolute on November 24, 1948. As the execution of the decree was stayed by the High Court, the executing court made an order on E.P. 13 of 1939 to the effect that the petition was \"closed\". On July 31, 1951, the 254 High Court dismissed C.M.A. 127 of 1948. On January 21, 1952, the decree-holders made an application being E.A. No.142 of 1952, in E.P. 13 of 1939 for reopening the said execution petition and for proceeding with the execution of the decree. The learned Subordinate Judge, holding that the previous execution petition was merely \"closed\", directed the decree-holders to file a regular execution petition. On October 11, 1952, the decree-holders filed E.P. No. 58 of 1953 to continue further proceedings in E.P. 13 of 1939 as per the order made in E.A. No. 142 of 1952 passed on October 4, 1952. In that petition the decree-holders prayed that the properties mentioned in the draft proclamation filed in E.P. No. 13 of 1.939 and brought to sale may be sold for he realization of the money due to the decree-holders and the proceeds applied for the discharge of the decree-debt. The judgment-debtors filed a counter-affidavit pleading, inter alia, that the decree sought to be executed was made on September 22, 1938, and that as E.P. No. 13 of 1939 was dismissed on December 28, 1948, the present application, having been filed more than 12 years from the date of the decree, was barred under s. 48 of the Code. The learned Subordinate Judge held that though the decree-holders were entitled to continue the previous execution petition, E.P.58 of 1953 was a fresh application, as in form as well as in details it materially differed from the original execution petition. On appeal, a division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court took a different view and held that E.P. 13 of 1939 was merely closed for statistical purposes and, there- fore, the execution petition filed in 1939 was still pending and the decree-holders were entitled to proceed with that petition. The High Court further observed that the said position was not contested by learned counsel for the res- pondents. We understand this observation only to mean that learned counsel appearing for the respondents therein did not contest the position that if the execution petition was not dismissed but was only closed for statistical purposes, the decree-holders were entitled to proceed with that petition. The High Court remanded the case to the learned Subordinate Judge for disposal according to law after considering the other contentions of the judgment-debtors.Hence the appeal.255 Mr. Suryaprakasam, learned counsel for the appellants, raised before us the following two points: (1) The previous execution petition was dismissed and, therefore, it was not pending at the time of filing of E.P. 58 of 1953, and, therefore, the later execution petition was a fresh application within the meaning of s. 48 of the Code; and (2) even if the previous application was only closed for statistical purposes, and the decree-holders could apply for reviving those proceedings, E.P. No. 58 of 1953 was a fresh execution petition because the parties and the properties proceeded against were different and the relief asked for was also different.Before we consider the question raised, it would be con- venient at the outset to look at the material provisions of s. 48 of the Code. It reads:\"(1) Where an application to execute a decree not being a decree granting an injunction has been made, no order for the execution of the same decree shall be made upon any fresh application Presented after the expiration of twelve years from-- (a) the date of the decree sought to be executed.\" This section corresponds to paras 3 and 4 of s. 230 of the Code of 1882. The relevant part of the section read:\"Where an application to execute a decree for the payment of money or delivery of other property has been made under this section and granted, no subsequent application to execute the same decree shall be granted after the expiration of twelve years from any of the following dates:A comparison of the said two provisions shows that the phrase \"fresh application\" has been substituted for \"subse- quent application\". This amendment became necessary in order to make it clear that the application mentioned in s.48 of the Code is a fresh substantive application and not an application to revive or continue a substantive application already pending on the file of the court.256 The question, therefore, is whether E.P. 58 of 1953 is a fresh application within the meaning of s. 48 of the Code.The answer to this question mainly turns upon the question whether the previous application i.e., E.P. 13 of 1939, was finally disposed of by the executing court. From the narra- tion of facts given by us earlier it is clear that the said execution petition was \"closed\" for statistical purposes.As the High Court stayed the execution pending the appeal filed by the judgment-debtors, the decree-holders were not in a position to proceed with the execution petition, and, therefore, it was closed. Some argument was raised on the question whether the said execution petition was closed for statistical purposes or was dismissed that it was contended that under the Code of Civil Procedure there was no power conferred upon a court to close execution proceedings for statistical purposes, and that even if such an order was made, it must be deemed to be an order dismissing the execution petition. The actual order dated December 28, 1948 has not been placed before us. But in E.P. 58 of 1953 in co]. 6 thereof it is mentioned that E.P. No. 13 of 1939 was closed on December 28, 1948. In the counter-affidavit filed by one of the judgment-debtors it is stated that E.P.13 of 1939 was dismissed on December 28, 1948 and not merely closed. After the disposal of the appeal by the High Court and before the filing of E.P. No. 58 of 1953, the decree- holders filed E.A. No. 142 of 1952 for reopening E.P. No. 13 of 1939. On that petition the learned Subordinate Judge made the following order:\"The previous E.P. was merely closed.Petitioner may file a regular E.P. on which proceedings will continue from the stage at which they were left in E.P. 13 of 1939.\" This order discloses that the previous execution petition was only closed. The Subordinate Judge must have presumably looked into the previous record. The learned Subordinate Judge proceeded on the assumption that the previous exe- cution petition was pending, though he dismissed the present execution petition on another ground. This factual position was not contested even in the High Court, for the High Court stated that the previous application was merely closed for 257 statistical purposes. In the circumstances we must proceed on the assumption that the Execution Petition 13 of 1939 was only closed for statistical purposes.Learned counsel for the appellants contends that the Code of Civil Procedure does not sanction the passing of an order closing an execution petition for statistical purposes and that practice has been condemned by courts. Under 0. XXI, r. 17(1) of the Code, the Court may reject an execution application if the requirements of rules 11 to 14 have not been complied with. Under r. 23 thereof, if the judgment- debtor does not appear or does not show cause to the satisfaction of the court why the decree should not be executed, the court shall order the decree to be executed, and where such person offers any objection to the execution of the decree, the Court shall consider such objection and make such orders as it thinks fit. Under r. 57 thereof, \"Where any property has been attached in execution of a decree but by reason of the decree-holder's default the Court is unable to proceed further with the application for execution, it shall either dismiss the application or for any sufficient reason adjourn the proceedings to a future date......... Relying upon these provisions it is argued that though the power of the court to make an order under 0.XXI, r. 23 (2) is wide and it can make any order it thinks fit, it can only make one or other of the two orders mentioned in r. 57 when it could not proceed with the execution because of the default of the decree-holder. It is said that in this case the decree-holders could not proceed with the execution in view of the stay order of the High Court and, therefore, the executing court could have either dismissed the application or adjourned the proceedings to a future date and it has no jurisdiction to pass an order closing the execution for statistical purposes. It is further said that an order closing proceedings for statistical purposes is not an order of adjournment, for an order of adjournment implies that the application is on the file, whereas the object of closing is to take it out of the file, though temporarily, and, therefore, the order, in effect and substance, is one of dismissal. Assuming that the order was made by reason of the decree-holder's default within the meaning of 0. XXI, r. 57 of the Code, we find it difficult to attribute something to the court which it never intended to 34 -159 3--C. 17 258 do. It is true courts have condemned the practice of exe- cuting courts using expressions like \"closed\", \"closed for statistical purposes\", \"struck off\", \"recorded\" etc., and they also pointed out that there was no provision in the Code of Civil Procedure for making such orders: see Biswa Sonan Chunder Gossyamy v. Binanda Chunder Dibingar Adhikar Gossyamy(1); Vadlamannati Damodara Rao v. The Official Receiver, Kistna(2); Moidin Kutty v. Doraiswami(3). It is not necessary to express our opinion on the question whether such procedure is sanctioned by the Code of Civil Procedure or not; but assuming that the court has no such power, the passing of such an order cannot tantamount to an order of dismissal, for the intention of the court in making an order is closed\" for statistical purposes is manifest. It is intended not to finally dispose of the application, but to keep it pending. Whether the order was without jurisdiction or whether it was valid, the legal position would be the same; in one case it would be ignored and in the other, it would mean what it stated. In either case the execution petition would be pending on the file of the court. That apart, it is not the phraseology used by the executing court that really matters, but it is really the substance of the order that is material. Whatever terminology may be used, it is for the court to ascertain having regard to the circumstances under which the said order was made, whether the court intended to finally terminate the execution proceedings. If it did not intend to do so, it must be held that the execution proceeding were pending on the file of the court. We have no hesitation, therefore, in agreeing with the High Court that E.P. 13 of 1939 is pending on the file of the executing court and that the present application is only an application to continue the same.Even so, it is contended that E.P. No. 58 of 1953 is a fresh application. Learned counsel compared the recitals in E.P.13 of 1939 and E.P. 58 of 1953 and pointed out that all the respondents in the former execution petition are not respondents in the present execution petition; that legal representatives of some of the defendnts are added to the present execution petition; that the decree-holders did not (1) (1884) I.L.R. 10 Cal. 422. (2) I.L.R. 1946 Mad. 527.(3) A.I.R. 1952 Mad. 51 .259 seek to proceed against all the properties against which they sought to proceed in the former execution petition; and that one of the reliefs, namely, to attach the amount deposited in court, asked for in the present execution petition is a completely new one and that, therefore, the present execution petition is, both in form and in particulars, completely a different one. But a comparison of the two execution petitions shows that the parties are the same: the new parties added in the present execution petition are either the legal representatives of the deceased parties or the representative of a party who has become insolvent. In the present execution petition the decree-holders are not proceeding against any property against which they did not seek to proceed in the earlier proceeding; they only omitted some of the properties. The decree-holders cannot be compelled to proceed against all the properties against which at one time they sought to proceed. The relief by way of attachment of the amount deposited in court had been asked for by the decree-holders by a separate petition, namely, E.A. No. 143 of 1962, and that was dismissed and, therefore, nothing turns upon it.The result is, therefore, in substance tinder both the execution petitions the decree-holders seek to proceed against the same parties and against the same properties.The law on the subject is well-settled. In Bandhu Singh v.Kayastha Trading Bank(1), where a decree-holder included new items of property for attachment in an application for execution of his decree filed 12 years after the date of the decree, it was held that the application to attach fresh property was a fresh application within the meaning of s. 48 of the Code and, therefore, having been made more than 12 years after the date of the decree, could not be entertained. In Sri Raja D. K. Venkata Lingama Nayanim v.Raja Inuganti Rajagopala Venkata Narasimha Rayanim(2). where an application was made for amending a pending execution petition with a view to attach another property not included in the pending application, the court held that the application for amendment could not be allowed, as it was made beyond the period of 12 years from the date of the decree. In Ippagunta Lakshminarasinga Rao v. Ippagunta (1) (1931) I.L.R. 53 All. 419.(2) I.L.R. 1947 Mad. 525 260 Balasubrahmanyam (1), where the execution petition filed beyond 12 years of the decree asked for a new relief not asked for in the earlier execution petition, it was held that the subsequent application, having been filed beyond 12 years, was hit by s. 48 of the Code. In Gajanand Sah v.Dayanand Thakur(2), the decree-holder was not allowed to substitute a new property different from the one against which he wished to proceed in the earlier application on the ground that 12 years had expired from the date of the passing of the decree.The result of the decisions may be summarized thus. An application made after 12 years from the date of the decree would be a fresh application within the meaning of s. 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if the previous application was finally disposed of. It would also be a fresh application if it asked for a relief against parties or properties different from those proceeded against in the previous execution petition or asked for a relief substantially different from that asked for in the earlier petition.In this case, as we have pointed out, the parties are sub- stantially the same in both the proceedings, and the decree- holders are only proceedings against properties included in the previous application. It cannot, therefore, be treated as a fresh application within the meaning of s. 48 of, the Code. It is only an application to continue E.P. No. 13 of 1939 which is pending on the file of the executing court.That apart, the decree-holders filed E.A. No. 142 of 1952 in E.P. No. 13 of 1939 expressly asking for the reopening of the said execution petition and for proceeding with it. As we have held that the earlier execution petition is still pending on the file of the court, the executing court will be well within its rights in proceeding on the basis of the earlier execution petition even without a new petition.In the result, we hold that the order of the High Court is right. The appeal fails and is dismissed. There Will be no order as to costs.(1)A.1.R. 1949 Mad, 251.) Appeal dismissed.(2)(1942) 1.L.R. 21 Pat. 838.LIIofIndia: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback\n",

      "All the petitioners were appointed Sub-Inspectors in the former Hyderabad State. They were considered for promotion as Circle Inspectors and their names were included in the eligibility list. On account of the merger of certain areas of the former State of Hyderabad into Mysore petitioners were transferred to Mysore. The petitioners were promoted ad hoc Circle Inspectors from the eligibility list received from the former Hyderabad State and they continued to act for varying periods as such. When certain confirmed Circle Inspectors who were on leave or on deputation outside the State returned to the new State, the petitioners were ordered to be reverted. When that happened, the petitioners filed writ petitions in the Mysore High Court in which they claimed that as they had been put in the eligibility list by the former Hyderabad State, they were entitled as of right to promotion as Circle Inspectors and to continue as such thereafter and the order of their reversion amounted to reduction in rank. They prayed for a writ, order or direction quashing the orders of reversion and directing the State Government to continue them as Circle Inspectors and confirm them as such. Their writ petitions were dismissed by the High Court and they came to this Court by special leave. They also filed writ petitions in this Court in addition to the appeals. Two others who had not appealed against the orders of the High Court also filed writ petitions in this Court.The contentions raised before this Court were that as their names were put in the eligibility list, they got an indefeasible right to promotion as Circle Inspectors, that after promotion on a temporary or officiating basis they got a right not to be reverted under any circumstances, that as they had worked for more than two years on probation, they became automatically confirmed under R. 486, that their reversions amounted to reduction in rank in view of R. 2 (c) and that they should be considered senior to other Circle Inspectors who were promoted after they were promoted as Circle Inspectors and therefore they should not have been reverted but the other Circle Inspectors who were promoted After them as Circle Inspectors should have been reverted on the principle that junior most officiating persons must be reverted.

The provision in the rule that promoted officers will be confirmed at the end of their probationary period, is qualified by the words \"if they have given satisfaction\". The competent authority must be satisfied about their work and the order of confirmation must be passed by that authority.Reversion in the present case does not amount to reduction in rank because the petitioners were never confirmed as Circle Inspectors and had no right to that post and their reversion was on account of exigencies of 281 service and not on account of any fault on their part.Reversion on account of exigencies of service as senior officers had come back from deputation or from leave, did not amount to reduction in rank.The petitioners could not rely on R. 2(c) in the peculiar circumstances prevailing in the State after re-organisation because promotions were made ad hoc without regard to inter se seniority of officers from different States.

Achar, for the respondent (in Petitions Nos. 173 and 174 of 1963).January 21, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO J.-These appeals and writ petitions raise common questions and will be dealt with together. The appeals arise out of six writ petitions filed in the Mysore 282 High Court and six of the writ petitions filed in this Court are by the same petitioners who applied in the Mysore High Court. Two writ petitions (Nos. 173 and 174) have been filed by two others. They also filed writ petitions in the High Court, though they have not filed appeals from the decision of the High Court. They will all be referred to as petitioners hereafter.The case before the High Court was briefly this. All the petitioners were appointed sub-inspectors in the former Hyderabad State, under s. 6 of the Hyderabad District Police Act (No. X of 1329 Fasli). Under r. 399 of the Hyderabad District Police Manual, issued by the Government of Hyderabad Linder s. 10 of the Hyderabad District Police Act, posts of circle inspectors were to be filled by promotion from the rank of sub-inspectors. The subsequent rules provided for the procedure for this purpose. The names of selected sub-inspectors who were considered fit for promotion were sent by the Deputy Inspectors General of Police and the Commissioner of City Police of Hyderabad to the Inspector General of Police. Thereafter a Board consisting of the Inspector General of Police and all the Deputy Inspectors General of Police, Commissioner of City Police, Hyderabad and Assistant Inspector General of Police interviewed the candidates and prepared an approved list of sub-inspectors fit for promotion. This approved list used to be called the eligibility list and promotions to the post of circle inspector used to be made from this list. The case of the petitioners in the High Court was that their names were included in the eligibility list published in the month of October 1956 before. the States Reorganisation Act (No. XXXVII of 1956) came into force on November, 1, 1956.They therefore contended that in view of the entry of their names in the eligibility list they were entitled as of right to promotion to the post of circle inspector as and when vacancies occurred. On the coming into force of the States Reorganisation Act, certain areas from the States of Bombay, Hyderabad, Madras and the whole of Coorg were made part of the new State of Mysore in addition to the existing State of Mysore. In consequence, certain public servants belonging to these States from which areas were added to the old State of Mysore were transferred to the new State 283 of Mysore thus formed out of the old State of Mysore and the areas added to it. Among these were the petitioners.Under s. 115 of the States Reorganisation Act, public servants so transferred were deemed to serve in connection with the affairs of the principal successor State.Provision was also made for the establishment of one or more advisory boards for the purpose of assistance in regard to the division and integration of services amongst the new states and the ensuring of fair -and equitable treatment to all persons affected by the State Reorganisation Act. Sec- tion 115 further provided that the conditions of service applicable immediately before the appointed day (namely, November 1, 1956) shall not be varied to the disadvantage of any person transferred to the new State except with tile previous approval of the Central Government. Section 116 (1) provided for the continuance of public servants in the same posts; but sub-s. (2) thereof laid down that nothing in sub-s. (1) shall prevent a competent authority after the appointed day from passing in relation to any such person any order affecting his continuance in such post or office, thereby recognising the right of the successor State inter alia to transfer officers anywhere in the new State after November 1, 1956.The petitioners continued to serve in the new State and as they were in the eligibility list referred to above they were promoted as circle inspectors on various dates after November 1, 1956. It may be mentioned that eligibility lists were received in the new State of Mysore from all the States from which areas had been transferred to it under the States Reorganisation Act and these lists continued to be acted upon as and when vacancies arose in the cadre of circle inspectors. It also appears that pending integration promotions were made from these eligibility lists ad hoc, or as they were called \"out of seniority\", and continued to be so made pending integration. The petitioners were thus promoted ad hoc circle inspectors from the eligibility list received from the former Hyderabad State and continued to act for varying periods as such. It appears further that the petitioners were ordered to be reverted when certain confirmed circle inspectors who were on leave or on deputation outside the State 284 returned to the new State. Thereupon the petitioners filed writs before the High Court in which they claimed that as they had been put in the eligibility list by the former Hyderabad State, they were entitled as of right to promotion as circle inspectors and to continue as such thereafter and the order of their reversion amounted to reduction in rank.They therefore prayed for a writ, order or direction quashing the orders dated September 6, 1962, ordering their reversion and directing the State Government to continue them as circle inspectors and to confirm them as such.Further during the course of arguments before the High Court, reliance was placed on r. 2(c) of the Seniority Rules framed by the Governor of Mysore in 1957 and the writ petitions before this Court are mainly based on that seniority rule to which we shall refer in due course.The case of the State Government was briefly this. It was admitted that after November 1, 1956, these officers were transferred to the new State of Mysore and eligibility lists were received from all the States from which territories and officers were tarnsferred to the new State of Mysore. As however integration of various services was bound to take time, the new State, by virtue of the powers conferred on it under the States Reorganisation Act, started acting on the eligibility lists received from the various States in anti- cipation of integration and promoting sub-inspectors to the rank of circle inspectors from those eligibility lists on an ad hoc basis and this was made clear in the various orders that were passed from time to time by using the words \"out of seniority\" when such promotions were made. Eventually a provisional integrated seniority list of all sub-inspectors including those who were officiating as circle inspector (hereinafter referred to as the provisional list) was prepared in February 1958. In 1962 when senior circle inspectors returned to the State from deputation, some officiating circle inspectors (other than the petitioners) were reverted. They filed writ petitions before the High Court in 1962 contending that even though they had been promoted later, they should not have been reverted in view of their position in the provisional list and that that list should have been adhered to and those junior to them in the provisional list should have been reverted. This contention was accepted by the High 285 Court and in consequence reversions began to be made in accordance with the provisional list in compliance with the view taken by the High Court. That was why the, juniormost sub-inspectors according to the provisional list who were in the eligibility list and who were officiating as circle inspectors were reverted. In consequence -the petitioners were also reverted when senior officers came back to the State. It was further urged that the eligibility lists gave no right to the sub-inspectors whose names were borne on those lists to promotion as circle inspectors, though it was not disputed that only those who were in the eligibility lists could be promoted as circle inspectors. But the fact that a sub-inspector's name was in the eligibility list did not confer any right on him to promotion in view of the Rules. Further it was contended that officiating circle inspectors could not claim confirmation as an automatic right after they had worked for a certain number of years as such and that they could only become confirmed circle inspectors when orders to that effect were expressly made by the Government. In the present cases the petitioners were never confirmed by the Government as inspectors. There was therefore no question of any reduction in rank. It is not in dispute that the petitioners were not reverted on account of any fault on their part; they had to be reverted only because of exigencies of service as senior inspectors had come back to the State from deputation or had returned from leave. It was urged that the reversion in the present case could not amount to reduction in rank and was in ordinary course due to exigencies of service. As to r. 2 (c) of the Seniority Rules, the case of the Government was that that rule governed the seniority of inspectors while they were acting as such and had nothing to do with the question of reversion, and in any case considering that promotions had been made after November 1, 1956 on ad hoc basis, the rule would not confer any right on the petitioners and the Government was justified in following the provisional list in view of the observations of the High Court referred to above. It was therefore contended that the petitioners had no right to the posts from which they were reverted and there was no reduction in rank and they were not entitled to any benefit of r. 2(c).286 The High Court accepted the contentions raised on behalf of the State and dismissed the petitions. Thereupon special leave was obtained by six of the petitioners in the High Court and that is how we have six appeals before us. These six appellants have also filed six writ petitions before this Court in addition to two other writ petitions filed by two other petitioners in the High Court who had not filed appeals.The first two questions that fall for consideration are whether the fact that a sub-inspector's name is put in the eligibility list gives an indefeasible right to him to promotion, and whether after such promotion on a temporary or officiating basis he gets a right not to be reverted under any circumstances. We are of opinion that the fact that a subinspector's name is in the eligibility list gives him no right of the kind urged on behalf of the petitioners.The rules in that behalf that are relevant are 399 to 403 of the Hyderabad District Police Manual. Rule 399 provides that vacancies in the rank of circle inspector are to be filled by the promotion of selected sub-inspectors and r.403 lays down that \"no direct appointments to the rank of Circle Inspector will be made\". Rule 400 prescribes the procedure for putting the names in the eligibility list.Rule 102 refers to sub-inspectors serving in the C.I.D. Rule 401 lays down that sub-inspectors whose names are entered in the approved list will be interviewed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police in the course of his cold weather tour and each sub-inspector's work during the year will be examined and report will then be made to the Inspector General of Police whether the officer had maintained his fitness for promotion or not. Thus r. 401 makes it clear that even after the sub-inspector's name is put in the eligibility list, his fitness for promotion is to be decided year by year and a report has to be made whether he has maintained his fitness for promotion or not. This obviously means that where a subinspector has not maintained his fitness his name can be removed from the eligibility list. It follows therefore that the mere fact that a sub- inspector's name is once put in the eligibility list does not give him an indefeasible right to promotion as a circle inspector. Then there is r. 486 which governs promotions generally. It lays down that promotion 287 cannot be claimed as a matter of right, though officers and men of all ranks are entitled to expect promotion' if they have good records, and if they are smart and efficient and have a thorough knowledge of their duties. This again clearly shows that merely because a sub-inspector's name is put in the eligibility list, he cannot claim promotion as a matter of right. Rule 486 further provides that all officers who are promoted will be on probation for a period of two years. They may be reverted at any time during this period by the authority competent to promote them, if their conduct and work are not satisfactory, or if they are found unsuitable for the appointment to which they have been promoted. This clearly shows that even where a sub-ins- pector has actually been promoted as circle inspector lie remains on probation for two years and during that period he is likely to be reverted if his work and conduct are not found satisfactory. This again negatives the contention on behalf of the petitioners that they had an indefeasible right to promotion because their names had been put on the eligibility list and that they could not be reverted after they had once started acting as circle inspectors. Lastly, r. 486 provides that promoted officers will be confirmed at the end of their probationary period if they have given satisfaction. This clearly shows that it is only when the probationary period is over and the promoted officer has given satisfaction during the whole of that period that he will be confirmed. It is clear therefore reading rr. 401 and 486 together that the mere fact that a sub-inspector's name is put in the eligibility list does not give him any indefeasible right to promotion. Further the fact that he is actually promoted, temporarily or as officiating, does not give him any right to continuance even during the period of two years' probation and he is liable to be reverted at any time even during those two years if his work is found unsatisfactory; it is only when the authority concerned has found that his work and conduct are satisfactory during the probation period that he can be confirmed. The contention of the petitioners that they had any right under the eligibility list for promotion or that after they had actually been promoted, they had a right to continue in the post of circle inspector, therefore, must be negatived.288 It has further been urged on the basis of r. 486 that as the petitioners had worked for more than two years on probation, they became automatically confirmed under the said rule, and reliance is placed on the following sentence in r. 486, namely, \"promoted officers will be confirmed at the end of their probationary period if they have given satisfaction\".The law on the question has been settled by this Court in Sukhbans Singh v. State of Punjab(1). It has been held in that case that a probationer cannot after the expiry of the probationary period automatically acquire the status of a permanent member of a service, unless of course the rules under which he is appointed expressly provide for such a result. Therefore even though a probationer may have continued to act in the post to which he is appointed on probation for more than the initial 'period of probation, he cannot become a permanent servant merely because of efflux of time, unless the Rules of service which govern him specifically lay down that the probationer will be automati- cally confirmed after the initial period of probation is over. It is contended on behalf of the petitioners before us that the part of r. 486 (which we have set out above) expressly provides for automatic confirmation after the period of probation is over. We are of opinion that there is no force in this contention. It is true that the words used in the sentence set out above are not that promoted officers will be eligible or qualified for promotion at the end of their probationary period which are the words to be often found in the rules in such cases; even so, though this part of r. 486 says that \"promoted officers will be confirmed at the end of their probationary period\", it is qualified by the words \"if they have given satisfaction\".Clearly therefore the rule does not contemplate automatic confirmation after the probationary period of two years, for a promoted officer can only be confirmed under this rule if he has given satisfaction. This condition of giving satisfaction must be fulfilled before a promoted officer can be confirmed under this rule and this condition obviously means that the authority competent to confirm him must pass an order to the effect that the probationay officer has given satisfaction and is therefore confirmed. The petitioners therefore cannot (1) [1962] INSC 126; A.I.R. 1962. S.C. 1711.289 claim that they must be treated as confirmed circle inspec- tors simply because they have worked for more than two years on probation; they can only become confirmed circle inspectors if an order to that effect has been passed even under this rule by the competent authority. The first con- tention therefore that the petitioners before us have an indefeasible right to promotion once their names are put in the eligibility list and that they are entitled to continue as circle inspectors thereafter if they have once been promoted, on temporary or officiating basis, cannot be sustained.This brings us to the next question whether the reversion in the present cases can be said to amount to reduction in rank. In view of what we have said above on the first point raised on behalf of the petitioners, it is clear that the petitioners cannot be treated as confirmed circle inspectors. It is not disputed that they have never been confirmed as such. It is also not disputed that they have not been reverted on account of any fault in their work.The reversion has been made simply because senior circle inspectors have come back to the State either from deputation or from leave and they have to be accommodated.Such reversion therefore cannot amount to reduction in rank for two reasons, firstly, because the petitioners before us were never confirmed as circle inspectors and had no right to that post, and secondly, because the reversion is on account of exigencies of service and not on account of any fault their part. Reversion on account of exigencies of service, as senior officers have come back from deputation or from leave, cannot in our opinion amount to reduction in rank. The contention of the petitioner that by this reversion they have been reduced in rank therefore fails.The next point that has been urged is that in any case till final integration of service -was made, the State Government was not entitled to take into account the provisional list of sub-inspectors and could only proceed to give promotions and to make transfers regionwise according to the eligibility lists of former States from which the territories came to the new State and if that was done the petitioners being senior in their region could not be reverted. We are of opinion that there is no force in this contention. It is 134-159 S.C.--19.290 true that for some time the State Government did proceed on this basis for there was no integrated list, whether pro- visional or final, available; but that does not mean that under the law it could not act on the provisional list once it was made till it was made final or that there was any estopped against the State Government in view of its having acted regionwise for sometime. We have already indicated that territories from four States came to the old State of Mysore to form the new State of Mysore and that necessarily raised difficult question of integration, and so the State Government made ad hoc promotions regionwise or out of seniority as was stated by it in various government orders.But the State is bound to be treated as one unit for purposes of administration. We may also refer to s. 116(2) of the States Reorganisation Act, which makes it clear that after the appointed day the whole State will be treated as one unit and nothing would prevent the competent authority after the appointed day from passing in relation to any such officer allotted to the new State any order affecting his continuance in such post or office. We cannot therefore accept the contention that the State Government was bound till the final list of integration was made, to make transfers only regionwise. We can see nothing in law which prevents the State Government from proceeding according to the provisional list after such list was prepared. We are of opinion that the view taken by the Mysore High Court in the earlier writ petitions after the framing of the provisional seniority list is correct and the State Government would be entitled to act on that list subject of course to this that if the provisional list is in any way altered when the final list is prepared, the State Government would give effect to the final list. The contention of the petitioners that the State Government should have continued to make promotions and transfers regionwise only even after the provisional list was made therefore must fail. It may be added that the State Government would be entitled and bound after the appointed day to treat the State as one whole unit and make such orders of transfer, as it thought fit, treating the whole State as one unit.Lastly, we come to the contention based on r. 2 (c) of the Mysore Seniority Rules which was argued before the 291 High Court at the hearing though it was not specifically raised in the petitions there and this is the main basis of the writ petitions before us. The rule was promulgated by the Governor of Mysore from February 1958 and is in these terms:- \"Seniority inter se of persons appointed on temporary basis will be determined by the dates of their continuous officiating in that grade and where the period of officiation is the same the seniority inter se in the lower grade shall prevail.\" The contention on behalf of the petitioners is that in view of this rule, they should be considered senior to other circle inspectors who were promoted after they were promoted as circle inspectors and therefore they should not have been reverted but the other circle inspectors who were promoted after them as circle inspectors should have been reverted, on the principle that junior-most officiating person must be reverted.Now r. 2(c) as it stands merely provides for seniority between persons officiating in a higher rank when they are officiating as such; it is not an express rule as to the manner in which reversion should be made where reversions are necessary on account of exigencies of service. The rule therefore cannot be held as expressly providing for the principle of \"last come first go\" with which one is familiar in industrial law. Strictly speaking therefore the petitioners cannot claim that r. 2 (c) has been violated by their reversion, for it does not provide for reversion and only provides for the seniority of officers who are officiating in a higher grade. Even so, it may be conceded that when reversion takes place on account of exigencies of public service, the usual principle is that the junior-most persons among those officiating in clear or long term vacancies are generally reverted to make room for the senior officers coming back from deputation or from leave etc.Further ordinarily as promotion on officiating basis is generally according to seniority, subject to fitness for promotion, the junior-most person reverted is usually the person promoted last. This state of affairs prevails oridinarily unless there are extraordinary circumstances, as in the present case. We have 292 already set out above that the new State of Mysore was formed of the territories of the old State of Mysore And the territories of four other States. The consequence of this was that officers from the other States as well as from the old State of Mysore became officers of the new State and the question of their integration inter se had to be decided in accordance with s. 115 of the States Reorganisation Act.That matter had to take time and therefore in the interest of administration ad hoc promotions continued to be made by the new State of Mysore after November 1, 1956. The result of this ad hoc promotion was that the normal principle of promotion based on seniority subject to fitness in a State where there is no question of integration could not work and that is why we find that orders were passed by the new State promoting sub-inspectors from various eligibility lists with regard to seniority inter se of officers from various States. It was only in 1958 that the provisional list of sub-inspectors was prepared. When this provisional list was prepared it was found that the promotions which had till then been made out of eligibility lists received from various States were not in accordance with the provisional list and it so happened in many cases that sub-inspectors who were seniors in the provisional list and who were also in the eligibility lists of the various States were promoted after sub-inspectors who were junior in the provisional list though they were also in the eligibility lists. It was because of these special circumstances arising out of the provisional list which began to be put into effect after 1958 that the situation arose that officiating inspectors who had been officiating for a longer time had to be reverted before officiating inspectors who had been officiating for a shorter time because of the seniority in the provisional list. We are therefore of opinion that it was because of the special circumstances after November 1, 1956 that the petitioners and those like them who were really junior to other subinspectors in the eligibility lists came to be promoted earlier because there was no provisional list available or in actual force when the promotions were made ad hoc and out of seniority. It was only when the provisional list was made that inter se seniority of officers coming from various States became prima facie known. Therefore when reversions had 293 to be made de on account of exigencies of service in accor- dance with the provisional list it was bound to happen in view of the earlier ad hoc promotions that some officiating inspectors who had been promoted earlier had to be reverted in preference to others who had been promoted later in these circumstances. It cannot therefore be said in view of the special circumstances prevailing in the State consequent on the States Reorganisation Act that the departure from the normal method of reversion was unjustified after the making of the provisional list. The petitioners therefore cannot rely on r. 2(c) in the peculiar circumstances prevailing in the State after the reorganisation because promotions were made ad hoc without regard to inter se seniority of officers from different States. It is only because of this special circumstance that it appears as if r. 2(c) is being disregarded in the matter of reversion for the promotions were made without regard to integrated seniority and resulted in sub-inspectors who were juniors in integrated seniority being promoted earlier. We are therefore of opinion that r. 2(c) does not strictly apply in the present case. But even on the basis that the junior-most should first be reverted in case reversion has to take place on account of exigencies of service, it cannot be said that the reversion of the petitioners is an act of discrimination, for the affidavit on behalf of the State Government shows that they are really junior-most in the provisional list though they might have in the exceptional circumstances indicated above acted longer as officiating circle inspector than others who have not been reverted. We are therefore of opinion that the charge of discrimination based on the violation of r. 2(c) cannot in the special circumstances of this case be sustained, for it is not in dispute that they were the juniormost according to the provisional list, when the orders of reversion were made.The appeals and the writ petitions therefore fail and are hereby dismissed. In the circumstances of this case, we make no order as to costs.Appeals and petitions dismissed.LIIofIndia: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback\n",

N. Mukherjee, for the respondent.276 January 21, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUDHOLKAR J.-This is an appeal against the judgment of the Calcutta High Court quashing the issue of process against the respondent.The respondent is an Assistant Commissioner of Police in the City of Calcutta and the appellant had made a complaint against him alleging that he had committed an offence under s. 348, I.P.C. that is, wrongful confinement in order to extort a confession or compel restoration of property.The facts as alleged by the appellant are as follows:One Manoharlal Seth had lodged a complaint on July 28, 1960 against him and two other persons Fatehlal and Jaichand for offences under s. 120B/420, I.P.C. and s. 420 I.P.C.Manoharlal Seth had alleged in his complaint that these persons had induced him to purchase a bar of brass for Rs.6,000 on the representation that it was of gold and thus duped him. Upon this complaint, investigation was taken up by the police. He came to know Manoharlal Seth in the course of his business. They were on quite friendly terms in the beginning and later on considerable differences arose between him and Manoharlal Seth. As a result of that Manoharlal Seth told him that unless he settled his differences with Manoharlal Seth according to the latter's dictates he would put him into trouble through his friend, the respondent, and that it is because of this that Manoharlal lodged a complaint against him for cheating.This complaint was thus a false complaint and it is common ground that ultimately it was dismissed by the Presidency Magistrate, 8th Court, Calcutta on January 2, 1961.Then according to the appellant, on August 3, 1960 at about 6-00 A.M. P. C. Kundu, Sub-Inspector of Police attached to Burrabazar Police Station along with another Sub-Inspector S. Bhattacharya, visited his residence, searched his house and arrested him. Neither of them had any warrant with them for the search of the house or for the 277 arrest of the appellant. Upon enquiry by him from these persons they told him that this was being done under the orders of the respondent. After his arrest the appellant said that he was taken to the Burrabazar police station at about 7-00 a.m. and then to Jorasanko Police Station and produced before T. K. Talukdar, Sub-Inspector in charge of that police station. From there he was taken to various places in Calcutta with a rope tied round his waist by Kundu and Bhattacharya and was eventually produced at about 12 noon before the respondent in his office at Lalbazar. There the respondent started threatening the appellant and asked him to settle the dispute with Manoharlal Seth and pay him Rs. 5,000 or to acknowledge in writing that he would pay this sum of money to Manoharlal Seth. At about 3-30 p.m. on the same day his brother Iswarilal accompanied by a lawyer Chakravarthy visited the respondent's office and sought the appellant's release on bail as the offence was a bailable one. The respondent, however, refused to grant bail saying that no bail would be granted until a sum of Rs. 5,000 was paid to Manoharlal Seth. The appellant says that he was detained at Lalbazar Police Station till 8-00 p.m. From there he was taken to Jorasanko Police Station and kept in the lock-up for the whole night. On the next day, that is, August 4, 1960 he was again produced before the respondent at Lalbazar where the latter repeated his threats and that after obtaining his finger prints and taking his photographs he was taken to the court of the Additional Chief Presidency Magistrate where he was released on bail at about 2-30 p.m.On August 19, 1960 the appellant preferred a complaint before the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Calcutta, under s.348 and s. 220, I.P.C. and s. 13C of the Calcutta Police Act, 1866. In so far as two of the persons named as accused therein, S. I. Kundu and S. I. Talukdar, he decided to issue process against them under s. 220 I.P.C. and s. 13C of the Calcutta Police Act. As regards the respondent, he decided to issue process against him under s. 348, I.P.C. Upon a revision application preferred by the respondent the High Court quashed the process issued against him by 278 the learned Chief Presidency Magistrate. The ground urged before; the High Court on behalf of the respondent was that before he could be proceeded against sanction of the State Government under s. 197, Cr. P.C. ought to have been obtained. This contention was upheld by the High Court.On.1 behalf of the appellant Mr. Sukumar Ghose contends that the High Court in quashing the process has proceeded to decide on the merits of the case even though there was no material before it to do so and that therefore its judgment cannot stand.It is true that for considering whether s. 197, Cr.P.C.would apply the Court must confine itself to the allegations made in the complaint. But that does not mean that it need not look beyond the form in which the allegations have been made and is incompetent to ascertain for itself their substance. Here the substantial allegation is that the respondent questioned the appellant when he was produced at his office in Lalbazar, asked him to restore Rs. 5,000 to Manoharlal Seth who had lodged a complaint of cheating against the appellant and two others and that he declined to release him on bail. No doubt the appellant has made a grievance in his complaint that the respondent said that the appellant would not be released on bail unless he either paid the amount or acknowledged in writing his liability to pay this amount. Assuming that the allegation is true all that the thing boils down to is that the respondent refused to enlarge the appellant on bail and that he wanted the appellant to settle the matter with Manoharlal Seth. It cannot be disputed that whether a person charged with an offence should or should not be released on bail was a matter within the discretion of the respondent and if while exercising a discretion he acted illegally by saying that bail would not be granted unless the appellant did something which the appellant was not bound to do, the respondent cannot be said to have acted otherwise than in his capacity as a public servant. For this reason the sanction of the appropriate authority for the respondent's prosecution was necessary under s. 197, Cr-P.C.279 Mr. Ghose, however, contends that the appellant's detention in the respondent's office was illegal and that, therefore, the respondent could not be said to have been in a position to exercise any lawful authority with respect to him. It is difficult to appreciate how the appellant's detention could be said to be illegal because it was in pursuance of the investigation of the complaint lodged by Manoharlal Seth that he was arrested and brought for interrogation before the respondent. It was not disputed before us that investigation into Manoharlal's complaint had been ordered though there is a dispute as to whether it was ordered by the respondent or by the Deputy Commissioner of Police.Whether it was by one or the other makes little difference.We would like to make it clear that Mr. Ghose did not contend before us that the appellant's detention in the office of the respondent was illegal because his initial arrest was without a warrant. But we may point out that a police officer is legally empowered to arrest a person alleged to have committed an offence under s. 420, I.P.C.without a warrant.Such being the position the High Court was justified in quashing the process. Accordingly we dismiss this appeal.Appeal dismissed.LIIofIndia: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback\n",
